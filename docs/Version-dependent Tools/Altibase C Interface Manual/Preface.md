#### Documentation Conventions

This section describes the conventions used in this manual. Understanding these conventions will make it easier to find information in this manual and in the other manuals in the series. 

There are two sets of conventions:

-   Syntax diagram convetions
-   Sample code conventions

##### Syntax Diagram Conventions

This manual describes command syntax using diagrams composed of the following elements:

| Elements                                                     | Meaning                                                      |

If a syntactic element starts with an arrow, it is not a complete command. |
| [![image2](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.3/eng/media/SQL/image2.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.3/eng/media/SQL/image2.gif) | Indicates that the command continues to the next line. If a syntactic element ends with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |

If a syntactic element starts witht his symbol, it is not a complete command. |

A comman must precede all but the first element. |

##### Sample Code Conventions

The code examples explain SQL statements, stored procedures, iSQL statements, and other command line syntax.

The following table describes the printing conventions used in the code examples.

| Rules            | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |

| Other Symbols    | Symbols other than those shown above are part of the actual code. | EXEC :p1 := 1; acc NUMBER(11,2)                              |
| Italics          | Statement elements in italics indicate variables and special values specified by the user. | SELECT \* FROM *table_name*; <br/>CONNECT *userID*/*password*; |
| Lower case words | Indicate program elements set by the user, such as table names, column names, file names, etc. | SELECT ename FROM employee;                                  |
| Upper case words | Keywords and all elements provided by the system appear in upper case. | DESC SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_;                                   |
