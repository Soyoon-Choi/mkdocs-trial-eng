# 1. Introduction

This chapter describes the concept of Adapter for JDBC and the structure of operation in which data changed in Altibase is replicated to other databases.

### Adapter for JDBC

Altibase's Adapter for JDBC(jdbcAdapter) is an utility which applies modified data in Altibase to other database supporing JDBC. jdbcAdapter has been implimented with Altibase Log Analysis API.

#### Structure and Concepts

In order to replicate modified data in Altibase to other databse, Altibase, jdbcAdapter, and other database, which supports JDBC, should be installed in the first place shown in Figure1-1.

jjdbcAdapter has been implimented with integration of Altibase Log Analysis API(ALA) and Java data base connectivity (JDBC). The ALA utility receives data that has been modified in Altibase whereas JDBC is used to send the data to other database. Refer to the L*og Analyzer User's Manual* for detailed information on ALA.

The following figure demonstrates how jdbcAdapter replicates from Altibase to other database.

[Figure 1-1] The structure of Adapter for JDBC

1.  XLogs within Altibase server creates XLog and meta information, and sends them to XLog collector. The meta information is only exchanged when handshaking takes place.
2.  The XLog collector existing within jdbcAdapter uses ALA to provide XLog and meta information to the user. If the call to ALA fails, a trace log will be written to the trc directory.
3.  jdbcAdapter uses ALA to covert data to apply obtained data to other database. 
4.  jdbcAdapter applies modified data to other database using JDBC through JNI.

#### Terms

##### XLog

An XLog is a logical log converted from a physical log. It stores transaction history involving DML(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statements.

##### XLog Sender

XLog Sender analyzes active redologs and converts them into XLog form to send to XLog collector.

XLog sender is mainly responsible for handsaking and XLog transmission.

##### XLog Collector

XLog Collector receives meta data and XLog from the XLog Sender.

XLog Collector contains meta table, an XLog queue, a transaction table, and an XLog pool.

##### Handshaking

Handshaking is the task of checking the protocol version and meta data before the XLog Sender sends XLogs to the XLog Collector.

##### Log Analysis API

Log Analysis API is an interface provided by Altibase and it is used to implement jdbcAdapter. The API provides XLogs and meta data that are used to interpret the XLogs.
