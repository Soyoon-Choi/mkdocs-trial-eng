# 4. Converting Data Types

The tables below show data type conversions between Altibase and a shapefile. The data information in a shapefile is stored in a .dbf file in dBASE format. Remember that the supported data type or precision may vary depending on the shapefile version.

### Converting Importing Data Types

| Data Type | dBASE field      | Altibase                | Note                                                         |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NUMBER    | NUMBER           | INTEGER, BIGINT, DOUBLE | Altibase data type is decided based on the dBase field's precision and whether it has scale. If is does, it is converted to DOUBLE type. If not, in case the precision is from 1 to 9, it is converted to INTEGER type. If the precision is greater than 10, it is converted to BIGINT type. |
| CHARACTER | CHARACTER        | VARCHAR                 | -                                                            |
| DATE      | DATE             | DATE                    | TIME type is not supported by dBASE.                         |
| BOOLEAN   | BOOLEAN(Logical) | VARCHAR(1)              | Altibase does not support BOOLEAN type. From the dbf file, T or F value will be imported as 'T' or 'F' and the remainder(1/0/null) will be processed as NULL. |

### Converting Exporting Data Types

| Data Type | Altibase                                               | dBASE field (precision) | Note                                                         |
| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  NUMBER   | SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT                              | NUMBER                  | Precision will be specified according to the Altibase data type and the scale is 0. |
|  NUMBER   | REAL, NUMBER, NUMERIC, DOUBLE, FLOAT                   | NUMBER                  | Specifies the precision and the scale according to the Altibase data type. |
| CHARACTER | CHAR, VARCHAR                                          | CHARACTER               | The maximum value of dBASE character is 255.                 |
| CHARACTER | NCHAR, NVARCHAR                                        | Unsupported             | -                                                            |
|   DATE    | DATE                                                   | DATE                    | Altibase supports TIME.<br />dBASE does not support TIME.    |
|  BINARY   | BINARY, BIT, VARBIT, BYTE, VARBYTE, NIBBLE, CLOB, BLOB | Unsupported             | -                                                            |

<a name="shapefile">1</a>  The shapefile format is a standard file format in geographic information system field. It is developed by a geographic information system software development company Esri. Three files below are required to compose a shapefile.

- .shp: vector format file that stores the feature geometry such as point, line and plane
- .shx: index file that stores the position of individual feature IDs in the .shp file
- .dbf: The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features
