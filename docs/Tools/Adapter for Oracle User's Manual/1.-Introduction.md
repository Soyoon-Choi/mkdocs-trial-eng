# 1. Introduction

This chapter describes the concept of the Adapter for Oracle and how data that has been changed in Altibase is written to an Oracle database.

### Adapter for Oracle

Altibaseâ€™s Adapter for Oracle (referred to as "oraAdapter") is a utility that enables data that has been modified in Altibase to be applied in an Oracle database.This is implented with Altibase Log Analysis API.

#### Structure and Concepts

To copy data that has been modified in Altibase to an Oracle DB, the user first needs to install Altibase, oraAdapter, and Oracle as shown in the following figure.

The Altibase Log Analysis API (referred to as "ALA"), and the Oracle Call Interface (referred to as "OCI") are integrated in oraAdapter. The ALA utility receives data that has been modified in Altibase, whereas OCI enables the data to be written to an Oracle database. For more detailed information about ALA, please refer to the *Log Analyzer User's Manual.*

The following figure illustrates how oraAdapter is used to apply data from Altibase to an Oracle database.

[Figure 1-1] The Structure of Adapter for Oracle

1.  When the user creates or updates data, an XLog Sender that exists within Altibase creates XLogs and meta information, and sends them to the XLog Collector. Note that meta information is exchanged only when handshaking takes place. 
2.  The XLog Collector, which exists within oraAdapter, uses ALA to provide XLogs and meta information to the user. If the call to ALA fails, a trace log will be written to the trc directory. 
3.  oraAdapter uses ALA to convert the acquired data so that the data can be used with an Oracle database. 
4.  The converted data is sent to the Oracle database using OCI.

#### Terms

##### XLog

An XLog is a logical log that is converted from a physical log. It stores the history of transactions involving DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statements.

##### XLog Sender

The XLog Sender is the module that analyzes active logs to create XLogs and then passes them on to the XLog collector. 

The XLog Sender actively performs handshaking and XLog transmission.

##### XLog Collector

The XLog Collector is the module that receives meta data and XLogs from the XLog Sender. The XLog Collector contains meta data, an XLog queue, a transaction table, and an XLog pool.

##### Handshaking

Handshaking is the task of checking the protocol version and metadata before the XLog sender sends the XLog to the XLog collector.

##### Log Analysis API

The Log Analysis API provides XLogs and meta data that are used to interpret the XLogs. This is mainly used to obtain XLog and meta information used to interpret XLog.

##### OCI

The Oracle Call Interface (OCI) is a set of C-language APIs that provide an interface with an Oracle database.

##### XLog Pool

The XLog pool is a pre-allocated memory space for storing XLogs.
