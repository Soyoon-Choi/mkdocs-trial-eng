# 1. Introduction

----

This chapter introduces the Altibase ODBC driver.

### Introduction

ODBC(Open Database Connectivity) is a standard programming language interface accessing databases, which is developed by Microsoft. In order that ODBC Application developed using ODBC API accesses a database, a specific module or driver(e.g., ODBC Driver Manager) the database providing is required. Altibase provides the Altibase ODBC driver, which conforms to ODBC 3.51 specifications, for this purpose.

As the Altibase ODBC driver is built upon Altibase CLI, you can refer to the Altibase CLI User's Manual for more detailed information on the internal procedures of the Altibase ODBC driver or for more specific description.

### Data Type

For more detailed information on on the mapping relationship between SQL data type and ODBC data type supported by Altibase, please refer to “B. Appendix: Data Types” in Altibase CLI User’s Manual.

### ODBC API

For more detailed further information on the ODBC API, please refer to the ODBC API Reference ([http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms714562%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms714562(v%3Dvs.85).aspx)

#### ODBC Conformance Level

Based on the conformance of ODBC functions, this section describes three types of functions: those that are currently supported for Altibase ODBC, those that are soon to be supported, and those that are not supported.

The purpose of specify the ODBC conformance level is to provide to the application, in- formation of which functionality of the ODBC driver to use. ODBC conformance is currently categorized into the three levels: Core, Level 1 and Level 2. To satisfy the conformance level of a function, the driver must meet all the conditions required for that level.

The following table shows the conformance level of the ODBC 3.x standard. This is different from the confromance level of ODBC 2.x;  Level 1 for ODBC 2.x can be seen here as a core.

The Altibase ODBC driver conforms to ODBC 3.51 specifications. The following table shows the conformance level of each ODBC function, and whether the Altibase ODBC driver is supported or not.
