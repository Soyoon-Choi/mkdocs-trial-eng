# 2. Installing and Configuring the Altibase ODBC Driver

------------

This chapter offers explanations on how to install and configure the Altibase ODBC driver.

### Installing the Altibase ODBC Driver

This section describes how to install the Altibase ODBC driver.

#### Unix-like Operating Systems

For Unix-like operating systems, the Altibase ODBC driver is also installed when you install the Altibase server or client package. For more detailed information on how to install the Altibase server or client package, please refer to the Installation Guide.

If you install the 64-bit package, the following 32-bit and 64-bit ODBC drivers are installed to$ALTIBASE_HOME/lib.

```
libaltibase\_odbc-64bit-ul32.so: SQLLEN size is 32 bits

libaltibase\_odbc-64bit-ul64.so: SQLLEN size is 64 bits
```

The reason why two drivers are included in the 64-bit package is as follows. The size of the SQLLEN type is defined by 64-bit ODBC Driver Managers as 64 bits. However, as unixODBC (one of the ODBC Driver Managers available for use in Unix-like operating systems) defines the size of the SQLLEN type to 32 or 64 bits, depending on the version and compile option, Altibase provides two drivers to offer a wide range of support. When using unixODBC, it is recommended that you select the driver that matches the SQLLEN size.

When installing the 32-bit package, the following file is installed to $ALTIBASE\_HOME/lib.

```
libaltibase_odbc.so
```

For HP operating systems, the file name is the same as above and has only an extension of sl.

### Configuration

This secion decribes how to configure the ODBC driver.

#### Unix-like Operating Systems

In order to use the ODBC driver in Unix, you must first install the ODBC Driver Manager. The unixODBC Driver Manager and iODBC Driver Manager are ODBC driver managers available for use in Unix. For more detailed information on each driver manager, please refer to the following links.

-   http://www.unixodbc.org/

-   http://www.iodbc.org/

##### Adding DSN

For an ODBC application to obtain access to the database, the DSN of the database must be added. The following dialog box appearswhen you click “Add” on the [Data Source(ODBC)] User DSN or System DSN tab. Then, select ODBC driver and click “Finish”.

When the “Altibase Connection Config” window appears, enter the following.

-   Windows DSN Name: Enter the data source name

-   Host (name or IP): Enter the host name or IP address of the computer on which the Altibase server to be accessed is running.
  
-   Port (default 20300): Enter the listening port number of the Altibase server. You can check the PORT_NO value from the altibase.properties file or the value of the ALTIBASE_PORT_NO environment variable.
  
-   User: Enter the database user name.

-   Password: Enter the database user password.

-   Database: Enter the database name.

-   NLS\_USE: Enter the client character set.

You can check whether or not the ODBC driver is successfully connected to the database by clicking “Test Connection”. Once you click “OK”, you will be able to see the data source added to the DSN tab in the name you have just entered.
