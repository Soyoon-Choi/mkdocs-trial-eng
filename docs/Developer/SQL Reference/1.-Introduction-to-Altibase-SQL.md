# 1. Introduction to Altibase SQL

This chapter describes the overview, classification, and structure of SQL for using Altibase.

### Overview of Altibase SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language for defining data objects and managing, manipulating, and searching data in a database. This section describes the characteristics of Altibase SQL.

#### Altibase SQL Features 

##### Superior Query Performance

Altibase creates an optimized execution plan tree when it is preparing a SQL statement. This is because the system catalog information for most queries does not change between the preparation and execution of the statement. The execution plan tree can greatly improve execution speed when the query is repeatedly executed. This is useful for applications that frequently execute Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements but seldom execute Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.

##### • Support for SQL-92

Altibase SQL fully supports SQL-92. Users familiar with SQL can easily use Altibase.

##### • Powerful Subquery Support

Subqueries are usually used in expressions for SELECT statements, CREATE TABLE ~ AS SELECT statements, and expressions and IN clauses for INSERT~ AS SELECT statements as well. Subqueries that are used like this mainly return multiple records from multiple columns. 

If the subquery result is a single value (a single record from a single column), it can be used as a constant. It is more efficient to use subqueries than multiple SQL statements, as subqueries run faster. Complicated applications should use subqueries.

##### • Support for Various System Functions

Altibase supports a wide variety of system functions, apart from SQL-92.

#### Query Optimizer and Execution Plans

SQL statements need to be written efficiently to enhance query performance. Understanding how Altibase processes SQL statements will help users to write optimized SQL statements.

Altibase processes a SQL statement in the following two steps: 

- Preparation  
  This step analyzes SQL statement syntax, checks its validity, optimizes it, and then creates an execution plan tree. While doing so, Altibase accesses meta tables and reads information about tables and indexes to create an optimized access plan.  
  If the client performs the preparation and execution steps separately (instead of directly executing the SQL statement), the meta information should not have been changed after preparation to use the execution plan tree that was created at preparation. For example, if an index that existed at preparation no longer exists at execution, the optimized execution plan tree becomes invalid and cannot be used.
- Execution  
  This step executes the query statement according to the execution plan that was created at preparation. If the client prepares a SQL statement using host variables and repeatedly executes the statement by changing the host variable values, Altibase prepares the statement only once but sets variable values and executes the statement multiple times. 

### Types of SQL Statements

Altibase supports SQL statements of the following categories:

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Data Control Language (DCL)

This chapter briefly introduces each SQL statement.

For more detailed information about their use, please refer to Chapter 3: Data Definition Language (DDL), Chapter 4: Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Chapter 5: Data Control Language (DCL).

#### Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL statements define and modify database objects.

[Table 1-1 ] List of Data Definition Languages

These DDL statements change meta information. When a DDL statement is executed, existing transactions are terminated and a new transaction executes the statement, which is then terminated after executing the transaction. DDL statements are SQL statements that are executed as a single transaction. This means that even if autocommit is turned off while a DML statement is executed and the statement remains uncommitted, Altibase commits the previously executed DML statement when a DDL statement is executed. DML transactions that were executed before a DDL statement is executed cannot be rolled back after the DDL statement has been executed.

#### Data Manipulation Language (DML) 

DML statements manipulate data. Unlike DDL statements, they are not automatically committed if autocommit is turned off. Therefore, if a transaction executes multiple DML statements and then calls the ROLLBACK function while autocommit is turned off, the transaction is rolled back. 

| SQL Statement | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
