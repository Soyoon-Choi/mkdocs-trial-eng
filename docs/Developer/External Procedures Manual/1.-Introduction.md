# 1. Introduction

This chapter introduces C/C++ external procedures and functions. In addition, this chapter introdces the needs for external procedures and discusses the features of Altibase external procedures.

### What are C/C++ External Procedures?

A C/C++ external procedure refers to a function written in C or C++, that is compiled and stored in the Dynamic Link Library(DLL). C/C++ external procedures can be used by calling them within SQL statements. An external procedure can be executed through Altibase external procedure object, and is executed in the same manner as calling a stored procedure within a SQL statement or an application program.

#### Common

External procedures provided by Altibase have the following features and advantages:

-   Since the implementation body and the call specification of C/C++ external procedures are unassociated, alteration of the C/C++ external procedure body does not require alteration of the calling program which calls the procedure.
-   Since the execution of C/C++ external procedures and Altibase server processes are separated, the database is not affected even if there is an error in the C/C++ external procedure written by the user. 
-   Inherent functions of the C/C++ languages, previously unsupported by PSM(Stored procedures), are available for use. 
-   Some computation-intensive tasks are executed most efficiently, when written in lower level programming languages, such as the C language. 
-   By simply converting previously written C/C++ functions to external procedures, calls can be directly made from PSM. In other words, it is possible to reuse the C / C ++ functions written once, thus reducing development costs.

##### External mode

-   Because the execution of C/C++ external procedures and the Altibase server process are separated, there is no problem in the database even if there is a problem in the database or with the C/C++ external procedures written by the user.

##### Internal mode

-   Since the ALtibase server process directly calls external procedures, the server may crash if the user written C/C++ external procedure is defective.
-   A memory leak may occur if memory allocated by a user-written C/C++ external procedure is not released
-   Therefore, it is necessary to sufficiently test the C/C++ external procedure written by the user so that there isn't any problem.

#### Flow of Calling External Procedures

Similar to regular stored procedures(PSM), external procedures can also be called in the client session. The overall flow from the creation of an external procedure to its invocation is depicted below. 

##### Common

After building a dynamic library from a user-written function in C or C++(an external procedure) and storing it in a location identifiable by Altibase, you should create an external procedure object (a stored procedure that registers the external procedure) with a SQL statement.

##### External mode

Afterwards, the stored procedure that registered the external procedure is called in the client session, and the Altibase server starts the Agent Process.

The Agent Process loads the dynamic library file related to the external procedure and executes the related C/C++ function within the library, and then sends the result to the Altibase server, which then returns the result to the client. 

##### Internal mode

When a stored procedure that registers an external procedure is called in a client session, the Altibase server calls the corresponding function. When creating a stored procedure that registers an external procedure or when compiling a dynamic library containing user-written C/C++ external procedrues. If multiple external procedures that use the same dynamic library are created, load the dynamic library only once and incremenet the reference count by 1.

Removing or recreating an external procedure reduces the number of dynamic library references, and unloads the dynamic library if there is no external procedure referencing the dynamic library. The number of external procedures referencing the dynamic library can be checked with V\$LIBRARY.

The following figure illustrates the flow of an external procedure called by the client and executed through the Agent Process.

#### Agent Process

The Agent Process is a process separately created by the Altibase server to load DLL files storing C/C++ functions for external procedures, and to execute functions within the DLL files. 

When the stored procedure that registered an external procedure is invoked in the client session, the Altibase server starts the Agent Process for external procedures. And when the execution of external procedures is complete, the Altibase server stands by for a while and, if no other external procedure is being executed, terminates the Agent Process. 

The Agent Process is subordinate to the service session of Altibase Server. If external procedures are called in multiple sessions, a corresponding number of Agent Processes will be generated, and when the sessions are terminated, the associated Agent Processes will also be terminated.

But in the internal mode of external procedures, no agent process is created.
