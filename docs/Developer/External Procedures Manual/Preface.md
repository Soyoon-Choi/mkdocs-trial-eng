There are two sets of conventions:

-   Syntax diagram convetions
-   Sample code conventions

##### Syntax Diagram Conventions

This manual describes command syntax using diagrams composed of the following elements:

| Elements                                                     | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [![image1](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image1.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image1.gif) | Indicates the start of a command. If a syntactic element starts with an arrow, it is not a complete command. |
| [![image2](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image2.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image2.gif) | Indicates that the command continues to the next line. If a syntactic element ends with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |
| [![image3](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image3.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image3.gif) | Indicates taht the command continues from the previous line. If a syntactic element starts witht his symbol, it is not a complete command. |

| [![image5](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image5.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image5.gif) | Indicates a manatory element.                                |
| [![image6](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image6.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image6.gif) | Indicates an optional element.                               |
| [![image7](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image7.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image7.gif) | Indicates a mandatory element comprised of options. One, and only one, option must be specified. |
| [![image8](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image8.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/../../media/SQL/image8.gif) | Indicates an optional element comprised of options.          |

A comman must precede all but the first element. |

##### Sample Code Conventions

The code examples explain SQL statements, stored procedures, iSQL statements, and other command line syntax.

The following table describes the printing conventions used in the code examples.

| Rules            | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [ ]              | Indicates an optional item                                   | VARCHAR [(*size*)] [[FIXED \|] VARIABLE]                     |
| { }              | Indicates a mandatory field for which one or more items must be selected. | { ENABLE \| DISABLE \| COMPILE }                             |
| \|               | A delimiter between optional or mandatory arguments.         | { ENABLE \| DISABLE \| COMPILE } [ ENABLE \| DISABLE \| COMPILE ] |
| . . .            | Indicates that the previous argument is repeated, or that sample code has been omitted. | SQL\> SELECT ename FROM employee;<br/> ENAME<br/>  -----------------------<br/> SWNO<br/>  HJNO<br/>  HSCHOI<br/>  .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> 20 rows selected. |
| Other Symbols    | Symbols other than those shown above are part of the actual code. | EXEC :p1 := 1; acc NUMBER(11,2)                              |
| Italics          | Statement elements in italics indicate variables and special values specified by the user. | SELECT \* FROM *table_name*; <br/>CONNECT *userID*/*password*; |
| Lower case words | Indicate program elements set by the user, such as table names, column names, file names, etc. | SELECT ename FROM employee;                                  |
| Upper case words | Keywords and all elements provided by the system appear in upper case. | DESC SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_;                                   |
