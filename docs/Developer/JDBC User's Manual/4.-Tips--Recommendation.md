# 4. Tips & Recommendation

This chapter shows how to use Altibase JDBC driver efficiently.

### Tips for Better Performance

The following tips should be kept in mind to enhance the performance of JDBC applications.

-   It is recommended to use the Stream or Writer object when using LOB data in JDBC applications. If the size of the LOB data to be used is equal to or smaller than 8192 bytes, the Lob_Cache_Threshold connection attribute must be set to an appropriate value. 
-   It is recommended to execute one operation on one Connection object. For example, if a multiple number of Statement objects are created in one Connection object and their operations are executed, this can induce performance loss. 
-   It is recommended to use the Connection Pool provided by Middleware (WAS) when the Connection object is frequently created and deleted. This is because the cost of connecting and terminating a Connection is relatively higher than other operations.
