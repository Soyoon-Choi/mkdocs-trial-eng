This chapter lists the SQL States of errors which can occur while using the Altibase JDBC driver.

### SQL States

The string value returned to SQLSTATE is composed of the first 2 characters which indicate the class and the following 3 characters which indicate the subclass. The class indicates the state and the subclass indicates the detailed state.

The following table lists the types of SQLSTATE which can occur in the Altibase JDBC driver and its meanings briefly.
