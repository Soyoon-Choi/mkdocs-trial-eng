# 12. Applications with Multiple Database Connections

### Overview

APRE supports the authoring of applications that establish more than one database connection. This chapter describes multiple connections and explains how to establish and maintain them.

#### The Need for Multiple Connections

Here are some of the circumstances in which it might be desirable to implement multiple database connections within a single application:

- When it is necessary to access multiple database servers from the same application 
- When multiple users need to access a database server using the same application 
- In multi-threaded applications. For more information about multi-threaded applications, please refer to Chapter 13: Multithreaded Applications.

#### Connection Name

In an application with multiple database connections, the connections are distinguished from one another using the connection names. The name of each connection must be unique within the application. Only one connection that does not have a connection name can exist within an application. This connection is called the “default connection”.

The name of each connection is set when the connection with a database server is established. To use this connection in subsequently executed embedded SQL statements, the connection name must be specified. If an attempt is made to establish a connection using the name of a connection that has already been established, an error will be raised, indicating that an established connection with that name already exists.

Each connection name must start with an alphabetic character (a ~ z, A ~ Z), the underscore character (“_”), or a dollar sign (“$”), and must not be longer than 50 bytes

##### Syntax

To specify a desired connection when executing an embedded SQL statement, use the AT option, as shown below: 

```
EXEC SQL [ AT <conn_name | :conn_name> ] …
```

##### Arguments

Both hard-coded strings and host variables can be used to specify the connection name. If using a host variable, it does not need to be declared in the host variable declaration section.

- \<*conn_name*\>: This is the name of the connection in the form of a string literal. 
- \<:*conn_name*\>: This is the name of the connection, stored in a host variable.

#### Steps for Authoring a Multiple-Connection Application

The process of authoring an application that uses multiple database connections is not much different from the process of authoring an application that uses only one database connection. The steps to follow when writing an application with multiple database connections are as follows:

1. Establish a connection to the database server. The name of the connection is defined at this time. 
2. Execute embedded SQL statements using the name of the established connection. 
3. Terminate the established connection.

### SQL Statements for Multi-Connections

The method of using embedded SQL statements in applications with multiple database connections is not very different from when using embedded SQL statements in other applications. The basic syntax of each command is the same; all that is additionally required is to specify the name of the connection using the AT clause. The following describes how to use embedded SQL statements in applications with multiple database connections.

#### CONNECT

This statement is used to establish a connection to the database server and define a name for the connection.

##### Syntax

```
EXEC SQL [ AT <conn_name | :conn_name> ] 
CONNECT <:user> IDENTIFIED BY <:passwd> 
[ USING <:conn_opt1> [ , <:conn_opt2> ] ];
```

##### Arguments

- \<*conn_name*\>: This is the name to use for the connection in the form of a string literal.
- \<:*conn_name*\>: cThis is the name to use for the connection, stored in a host variable. 
- \<:*user*\>: This is the name of the user with which to connect to the database server.
- \<:*passwd*\>: This is the password for the user with which the connection to the database server is established.
- \<:*conn_opt1*\> : Please refer to Chapter 6: Embedded SQL Statements.
- \<:*conn_opt2*\> : Please refer to Chapter 6: Embedded SQL Statements.

##### Description

When establishing more than one connection in one application, it is necessary to specify a name for every connection except the default connection. The name of each connection must be unique within the application. After the connection has been established, the name of the connection to use in subsequently executed embedded SQL statements must be specified using the AT clause.

> ##### Notes
>
> - In an application with multiple database connections, only one connection that does not have a name is allowed. If no connection name is specified in subsequently executed embedded SQL statements, they will be processed using this connection (the default connection).
> - If an attempt is made to establish a connection using the name of an established connection, an error will be raised, indicating that an established connection with that name already exists. To establish a new connection using the same name as an existing connection, it is first necessary to execute the FREE or DISCONNECT statement. If the database server is online, execute the DISCONNECT statement, whereas if the database server is offline, execute the FREE statement.
> 

##### Examples

The following two examples illustrate how to specify the name of a connection when establishing a connection.

[Example 1] In the following example, a connection is established with a database server, and the connection is identified using the provided string literal. Thus, “CONN1” is the name of the established connection.

< Sample Program: mc1.sc >

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char usr[10];
char pwd[10];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

/* set username */
strcpy(usr, "SYS");
/* set password */
strcpy(pwd, "MANAGER");

/* connect to altibase server with CONN1 */
EXEC SQL AT CONN1 CONNECT :usr IDENTIFIED BY :pwd;  
```

[Example 2] In this example, a connection is established with a database server, and the connection is identified using the value of the host variable. Thus, “CONN2” is the name of the established connection.

\< Sample Program : mc2.sc \>

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char usr[10];
char pwd[10];
char conn_name2[10];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

/* set username */
strcpy(usr, "ALTITEST");
/* set password */
strcpy(pwd, "ALTITEST");
/* set connname */
strcpy(conn_name2, "CONN2");

/* connect to altibase server with :conn_name2 */
EXEC SQL AT :conn_name2 CONNECT :usr IDENTIFIED BY :pwd;  
```

#### DISCONNECT

This statement is used to terminate the database server connection identified by the specified connection name.

##### Syntax

```
EXEC SQL [ AT <conn_name | :conn_name> ]
DISCONNECT;
```

##### Arguments

- \<*conn_name*\>: This is the name of the connection to terminate in the form of a string literal. 
- \<:*conn_name*\>: This is the name of the connection to terminate, stored in a host variable. 

> ##### Notes
>
> The connection name, if specified, must be the name of a valid connection, that is, a connection that has already been established.
>
> In an application in which multiple database connections have been established, it will be necessary to specify the name of each connection, except for the default connection, when terminating the connection.

##### Examples

The following two examples illustrate how to terminate a connection.

[Example 1] In the following example, a connection with a database server, identified using a string literal, is terminated. The name of the connection to be terminated is “CONN1”.

< Sample Program: mc1.sc >

```
EXEC SQL AT CONN1 DISCONNECT;
```

[Example 2] In the following example, a connection with a database server, identified using a host variable, is terminated. The name of the connection to be terminated is “CONN2”.

< Sample Program: mc2.sc > 

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char conn_name2[10];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

strcpy(conn_name2, "CONN2");
EXEC SQL AT :conn_name2 DISCONNECT;
```

#### Executing Basic SQL Statements

The method of specifying the connection when executing DML statements such as SELECT and UPDATE and DDL statements such as CREATE and DROP is explained in this section.

##### Syntax

```
EXEC SQL [ AT <conn_name | :conn_name> ] 
[ SELECT | UPDATE | INSERT | DELETE | CREATE ] … 
```

##### Arguments

- \<:*conn_name*\> : This is the name of the connection, stored in a host) variable. 

> ##### Note: 
>
> The connection name, if specified, must be the name of a valid connection, that is, a connection that has already been established.
>

#### Cursor Statements

The method of specifying the connection when executing cursor-related embedded SQL statements is explained in this section.

##### Syntax

```
EXEC SQL [ AT <conn_name | :conn_name> ] 
[ DELCARE | OPEN | FETCH | CLOSE ]  <cursor_name> … 
```

##### Syntax

```
EXEC SQL INCLUDE …
EXEC SQL OPTION …
EXEX SQL WHENEVER …
```



### Using Stored Procedures in Multiple-Connection Applications
