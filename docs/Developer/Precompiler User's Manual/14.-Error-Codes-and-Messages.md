# 14. Error Codes and Messages

### Precompiler Errors

The messages for the errors that can be raised during the precompile operation have the following format:

#### Error Format

```
[ERR-<error code> : <error message>]
File    : <file name>
Line    : <line number>
Offset  : <n-m>
Error_token : <error token>
<error code>: This is the numerical code corresponding to the error that occurred.
<error message>: This is the corresponding error message.
<file name>: This is the name of the file containing the code that caused the error.
<line number>: This is the number of the line in which the error occurred.
<n-m>: This is the start and end character indicating the portion of the line in which the error occurred.
<error statement>: This is the kind of statement that caused the error.
```

##### Example

The following example shows the error that is raised when the EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION statement is missing from the source code.

```
[ERR-302L : EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION is not exist.]
File  : tmp.sc
Line  : 4
Offset: 1-31
Error_token:EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
```

#### Error Code Format

The error code system that occurs during preprocessing is as follows.

ERR-xxxY

xxx: This is the error number. 

Y: This is a single alphabetic character that indicates the error category (see below).

#### Error Numbers

The error numbers fall within certain ranges that indicate the kind of error that occurred. These ranges are as follows:

101 – 199: These are system errors. 

201 – 299: These are errors related to host variables. 

301 – 399: These are cursor-related errors. 

401 – 499: These are general errors. 

701 – 799: These are errors related to the lack of support for some functionality in the current version.

#### Error Categories

These error categories indicate the precompiling task that was underway when the error occurred.

E: This indicates that the error occurred while processing the host variable declaration section. 

L: This indicates that the error occurred while processing an embedded SQL statement. 

M: This indicates that the error occurred while performing macro substitutions. 

H: This indicates that the error occurred when performing a task other than those listed above.
