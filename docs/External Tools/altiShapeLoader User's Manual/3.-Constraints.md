# 3. Constraints

Since altiShapeLoader is programmed based on GeoTools, an open-source library based on Java, GeoTools' constraints apply to altiShapeLoader as well.

### Shapefile Constraints

- A shapefile can only have one spatial data column (geometry) and one type of spatial data. (More than one type cannot be stored together. For example, polygon and line.)
- The size of each component of shapefile is only supported up to 2GB.
- The name of the property field cannot exceed 10 characters.
- The maximum number of the property field is 255 and any property fields exceeding this will be ignored.
- Only four data types are supported: NUMBER, FLOAT, CHARACTER(255), DATE

The above constraints can be also found on https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/shapefiles/geoprocessing-considerations-for-shapefile-output.htm.
