### Enumeration Types 

The following enumeration types can be used with Altibase Monitoring API applications. 

#### enum ABIPropType

This enumeration type is used with the ABISetProperty function to specify the user name and user password for connecting to an Altibase server.

This enumeration type has the following elements.

| Element     | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ABI_USER    | Used to specify the user name                                |
| ABI_PASSWD  | Used to specify the user password                            |
| ABI_LOGFILE | Used to specify the file that stores the error messages that occur in Altibase Monitoring API |

### Considerations

Almost all Altibase Monitoring API functions take the above data structures as arguments. This section discusses what you should consider when taking these data structures as arguments. 

In an application, you need to declare a pointer variable to a data structure and pass this pointer’s address value (a double pointer) to an Altibase Monitoring API function. The function allocates memory on heap to the pointer and sets it to the record fetched from the database, and then returns the result set to the application. 

Because Altibase Monitoring API functions manage memory for data structures used with Altibase Monitoring API, the application should not directly allocate memory to a pointer in the data structure or deallocate memory returned as the result of a function. 

As shown in the following sample code, a pointer in an ABIVSession data structure should be only declared and memory should not be allocated to sVSession. Moreover, if a result value is referenced from sVSession after a function has been executed, only as many array elements as the number of rows in the result set can be accessed.

```
ABIVSession *sVSession;
int sRowCount;

sRowCount = ABIGetVSession(  &sVSession, 0 );

/*  reference the results selected from sVSession */
for (int i=0; i<sRowCount; i++)
{
    /* sVSession[i].mID; */
    /* sVSession[i].mTransID; */
} 
```
