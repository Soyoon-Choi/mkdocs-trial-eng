# 3. GUI Mode Quick Guide

This chapter provides a quick step guide for users new to Migration Center.

### Quick Step Guide for GUI User

The users can easily perform migration in GUI mode with this quick step guide. The overall process is listed below.

1. Start Migration Center

2. Prepare the project
   
   1. Register source and destination database connections 
   2. Create a project 
   3. Open the project 
   4. Connect to source and destination databases 
   5. Set migration options

3. Build the project

4. Reconcile the project

5. Run the project

6. Validate the project

#### Starting Migration Center

Double-click the “migcenter.bat” icon in the Migration Center folder on Microsoft Windows. Execute “migcenter.sh” on Unix-like operating systems. To use Migration Center on any environment other than a 64-bit version of Windows, please check that Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed, and that the PATH environment variable is set appropriately so that the JRE can be accessed from the terminal.

#### Registering a Database Connection

1. From the “Database” menu, select the “Add Database Connection” submenu, or click the “Add Database Connection” icon in the main toolbar. 

2. Fill in all the input fields of the “Add Database Connection” dialog box:
   
   1. DB Product: The database system name 
   
   2. Connection Name: A unique database connection name to be used for Migration Center projects
   
   3. IP: The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the database server
   
   4. Port: The port number of the database server or SSL port number of the Altibase server
   
   5. User: The valid user ID for the database
   
   6. Password: The password corresponding to the user ID for the database.
   
   7. JDBC Driver:  The JDBC driver path to be used to connect to the database.
   
   8. Encoding: The default character set used on the client.
   
   9. IP Version: The IP protocol version used in this connection.
   
   10. Property: The JDBC driver property to be used in this connection.   
       If connecting with SSL, set ssl_enable = true as shown below, and * path_to_keystore, path_to_truststore, and password * are set according to each authentication environment.

```
ssl_enable=true&keystore_url=path_to_keystore&keystore_password=password&truststore_url=path_to_truststore&truststore_password=password 
```

3. Click the “Test” button at the bottom of the dialog box to check the input information before adding this connection to the connection list.

4. If the connection test is successful, click the “OK” button at the bottom of the dialog box to add the connection to the connection list. Then, close the “Add Database Connection” dialog box.

#### Creating the Project

1. From the “Project” menu, select the “Create Project” submenu, or click the “Create Project” icon in the main toolbar.

2. Fill in the input fields in the “New Project” dialog box:
   
   1. Project Name: A migration project name that is unique in Migration Center and meaningful to the user.
   2. Project Path: The folder path where migration project files will be stored. This value cannot be edited by users.
   3. Source Database: A database that contains database objects to be migrated in this project.
   4. Destination Database: An Altibase database to copy database objects from the source database and store them. This input field is mandatory, even if the project is configured for “DB to File” migration.

3. Click the “OK” button at the bottom of the “New Project” dialog box.

#### Opening the Project

To open a project, select the “Open Project” submenu from the “Project” menu. A file “Open” dialog box appears. The user only needs to choose a project folder and click the “Open” button.

#### Configuring the Project

The user can configure the project’s basic strategy prior to setting project details. For further information, please refer to Migration Options.

#### Connecting to Source and Destination Databases

Establishing connections with the source and destination databases is essential to proceed to the Build step. To connect the databases for the project, select the “Connect” submenu from the “Project” menu, or right-click the open project and click “Connect.”

#### Building the Project

The Build step is indispensible to migration, yet simple to execute. 

1. Click "Build User" or "Build Table" from the "Migration" menu or the main toolbar.

2. A dialog box asking how to fetch records from each table in the source database appears. Select the desired method and click “OK”. For further information about the available options and explanations thereof, refer to Internal Activities.

3. If "Build Table" has been selected, a dialog box shows up to list the names of migration target tables. When clicking the"![](../../media/MigrationCenter/f614c334dace127d00b84a2951b20ff2.png)" button, you can choose migration target tables with name search. After completing configuring the table list, click the "Build" button to proceed with the build step.

4. A “Build” dialog box displaying the build progress appears. At completion, a “Report” button appears at the bottom. 

5. If you click “Report”, an HTML report file is created in the project directory and the “Build Report” dialog box appears. This dialog box provides a link to the HTML report file. Once the “Report” button is clicked and an HTML report file is created, the “Build Report” submenu from the “Report” menu is activated. The user can open the “Build Report” dialog box at any time with this menu item.

#### Reconciling the Project

The Reconcile step is very important because it determines how to execute the Run step, and it requires some knowledge of both source and destination databases. For further information about this step, please refer to Migration Center Internals. The following is a simple guide:

1. From the “Migration” menu, select “Reconcile”, or click the “Reconcile” icon in the main toolbar.

2. Change or confirm the default data type mapping.

3. Specify the Altibase tablespaces to which the source database is to be migrated.

4. Change or confirm how to migrate partitioned tables in the source database to Altibase.

5. Specify the Altibase tablespace to which each table or index in the source database is to be migrated.

6. Check the SELECT statement for fetching data from each table of the source database, and make changes if necessary. 

7. Check whether the DDL SQL statements to be used during the schema migration process is correct, and make changes if necessary.

8. Click the “Report” button to generate a report for this step.

#### Running the Project

The Run step can be as easily executed as the Build step, but is irreversible. Please check all settings before proceeding any further.

1. From the “Migration” menu, select the “Run” submenu, or click the “Run” icon in the main toolbar. 
2. Click “OK” in the warning dialog box to confirm that every configuration is correct. 
3. Review the progress and final report closely.

#### Validating the Project

The Data Validation step checks whether data migration was properly performed in the Run step.

1. From the “Migration” menu, select the “Data Validation” submenu. 
2. Click “OK” in the warning dialog box to confirm that every configuration is correct. The “Data Validation” dialog box appears and the Data Validation step is executed. 
3. At completion, a “Report” button appears at the bottom. 
4. If you click “Report”, an HTML report file is created in the project directory and the “Data Validation Report” dialog box appears. This dialog box provides a link to the HTML report file. Once the “Report” button is clicked and an HTML report file is created, the “Data Validation Report” submenu from the “Report” menu is activated and the user can open the “Data Validation Report” dialog box at any time with this submenu. 
5. If there is a difference between the data of the source and destination databases in the report, the user can synchronize the data with the filesync feature.

The following is a simple guide for using filesync.

1. From the “Migration” menu, select the “Migration Options” submenu. 
2. Click “OK” in the warning dialog box. 
3. Select “FILESYNC” in the “Operation” combo box from the “Data Validation Options” submenu, and click “OK”. 
4. From the “Migration” menu, select the “Reconcile” submenu, or click the “Reconcile” icon in the main toolbar. 
5. Select “Table Mode” in the dialog box that appears. 
6. Select the table to perform data synchronization on. 
7. Click “Next” until the Reconcile step completes. 
8. From the “Migration” menu, select the “Data Validation” submenu. 
9. The “Data Validation” dialog box appears and filesync is executed. At completion, a “Report” button appears at the bottom. 
10. Check that data difference has been solved in the report.
