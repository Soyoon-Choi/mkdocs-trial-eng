# Appendix C: Data Type Mapping

Migration Centerâ€™s policy for mapping data types between heterogeneous databases is to minimize the loss of data. However, the user may wish to customize the way that data is mapped, even if it incurs the loss or corruption of data. To satisfy this requirement, Migration Center also allows the user to edit the data type mapping table.

This chapter explains how to check and customize the default data type mapping table during the project progress of the Migration Center. It also explains the precautions that users need to know in the Migration Center's default data type mapping table.

### Manipulating Data Type Mapping

The user can change the data type mapping table in the reconcile stage as shown below.

**1.Reconcile**

Right-click in the project tree window and select the Reconcile menu. Or select Reconcile from the Migration menu. You must complete the Build step before you can perform this step.

**2. Data Type Mapping**

*Reconcile* menu is clicked, the Reconcile window appears as shown below. In this window, users can view the default data type mapping table of Migration Center and change the data type of the target database in "1. Data Type Mapping". Select the data type you want to change and click the *Change* button at the bottom right.

**3. Change Mapping Type**

*Change* button is clicked, the following window appears. In the "Change Mapping Type" window, select the data type to change in the Destination DB Data Type. Depending on the data type, enter Precision and Scale if necessary, and click the *OK* button.

### Default Data Type Mapping Tables

These tables describe the basic data type mapping tables between heterogeneous databases and precautions that users should be aware of.

Since Migration Center 7.11, if a table's column length of a source database exceeds the maximum range of the data type mapped to the target database, the data type of the target database can be automatically converted to a data type with a larger range than the default mapping table. For instance, the following data types can be changed to CLOB if necessary in order to minimize data loss.

#### Oracle to Altibase

|      | Source        | Destination     | Notice                                                       |
| :--: | :------------ | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | CHAR          | CHAR            | CHAR type columns defined with character length in Oracle are automatically converted to CHAR type columns with byte length in Altibase, because in Altibase, CHAR type columns can be defined only with byte length. |
|  2   | NCHAR         | NCHAR           | The explicit sizes of the source and destination NCHAR columns are the same, e.g. NCHAR(10) -> NCHAR(10). <br/>However, in the Oracle JDBC driver, the size of a national character column is defined as the number of bytes used, whereas in the Altibase JDBC driver, the size of a national character column is defined as the number of characters that are stored. Please note that this means that the resultant column in Altibase will be two or three times as large as necessary. |
|  3   | VARCHAR2      | VARCHAR         | VARCHAR2 defined as character length in Oracle is converted into bytes in Altibase. Altibase's VARCHAR can be defined only in bytes. |
|  4   | NVARCHAR2     | NVARCHAR        | The column sizes differ, for the same reason as NCHAR.       |
|  5   | LONG          | CLOB            |                                                              |
|  6   | NUMBER        | NUMBER          | NUMBER type columns defined without precision and scale in Oracle are converted to the same NUMBER type columns without precision and scale for Altibase. *Both Oracle and Altibase internally handle NUMBER type columns defined without precision and scale as FLOAT type in the database. |
|  7   | FLOAT         | FLOAT           |                                                              |

|  9   | BINARY DOUBLE | VARCHAR(310)    | There is no compatible data type in Altibase for the Oracle binary double type, so the data is stored in character form to prevent loss. |
|  10  | DATE          | DATE            |                                                              |
|  11  | TIMESTAMP     | DATE            | A small amount of data loss may occur due to the difference in scale. <br/>In Oracle, the scale of a timestamp value is nanoseconds (9 digits), whereas in Altibase, the scale of a timestamp value is microseconds (6 digits) |
|  12  | RAW           | BLOB            |                                                              |
|  13  | LONG RAW      | BLOB            |                                                              |
|  14  | BLOB          | BLOB            |                                                              |
|  15  | CLOB          | CLOB            |                                                              |
|  16  | NCLOB         | NVARCHAR(10666) | There is no compatible data type in Altibase for the Oracle NCLOB, so the data is stored in NVARCHAR with the maximum precision. This may cause data loss during data migration when the actual data precision exceeds the NVARCHAR maximum size. |
|  17  | ROWID         | VARCHAR(18)     | Oracle's ROWID converts to a character data type. Altibase does not support the data type ROWID. |

|  1   | CHAR          | CHAR            | Since Altibase's CHAR type can be defined only in byte length, in case of a column defined as character length in Tibero, it is automatically converted to byte length. |

|  6   | NUMBER        | NUMERIC         | NUMBER type columns defined without precision and scale in Tibero are converted to the same NUMBER type columns without precision and scale for Altibase. *Both Tibero and Altibase internally handle NUMBER type columns defined without precision and scale as FLOAT type in the database. |

|  8   | BINARY DOUBLE | VARCHAR(310)    | There is no compatible data type in Altibase for the Tibero binary double type, so the data is stored in character form to prevent loss. |

|  11  | TIMESTAMP     | DATE            | A small amount of data loss may occur due to the difference in scale. In Tibero, the scale of a timestamp value is nanoseconds (9 digits), whereas in Altibase, the scale of a timestamp value is microseconds (6 digits). |

|  16  | NCLOB         | NVARCHAR(10666) | There is no compatible data type in Altibase for the Tibero NCLOB, so the data is stored in NVARCHAR with the maximum precision. This may cause data loss during data migration when the actual data precision exceeds the NVARCHAR maximum size. |
|  17  | ROWID         | VARCHAR(18)     | Tibero's ROWID converts to a character data type. Altibase does not support the data type ROWID. |

### Automatic Correction of Character Column Length Considering Heterogeneous Character Set

When the character sets of the source and destination databases are different during migration, character data types (CHAR, VARCHAR) require length conversion.
For example, if the source database is set to the MS949 character set that requires a maximum of 2 bytes per character storage, and the target database is set to the UTF8 character set that requires 3 bytes per character, the character data of the target database is required to migrate without truncation. The size of the type should be 1.5 times the original.

Migration Center automatically performs this length conversion, and the length correction formula for character data types is as follows.

```
Dest. Size = Ceil(Correction Factor * Src. Size)
Correction Factor = Dest. MaxBytes / Src. MaxBytes
* MaxBytes = The maximum number of bytes required to store one character
```

However, if MaxBytes of the original is 1 or the correction factor is less than 1, the length conversion is not performed.

The MaxBytes and correction factors of the source and target databases can be found on the summary page of the build report.

#### Precautions

For large tables, the length of data storage in the target database can be much larger than the original due to length correction. If there is a guarantee that the data will not be truncated without converting the length, the length can be manually specified in the reconcile step.

#### Support Character Set for Each Database

For character sets not listed in the table below, Migration Center does not perform length correction.
