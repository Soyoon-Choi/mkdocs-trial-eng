### FAQ

#### Unable to Retrieve LOB Type Data.

DBeaver is configured with Auto-Commit as the default setting. To retrieve Altibase LOB type data, users need to change the commit mode from Auto-Commit to Manual Commit.

There are three methods to change the commit mode:

1. Click on the ▼ in the toolbar to switch to Manual Commit mode.

   ![commit1](media/DBeaver/commit1.png)

| Button Icon                           | Commit Mode   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ![button1](media/DBeaver/button1.png) | Auto-Commit   |
| ![button2](media/DBeaver/button2.png) | Manual Commit |

2. Select "Manual Commit" from the list of commit modes.

   ![commit2](media/DBeaver/commit2.png)

3. Deselect the "Auto-commit" default setting option in the menu and reconnect to the database.

   [ Window ] → [ Preferences ]

   ![commit3](media/DBeaver/commit3.png)

Click [ Connections ] → [ Connection Types ]

Uncheck the "Auto-commit by default" check box, then click [ Apply and Close].

Reconnect to the database.

#### The SYSTEM_ schema is not visible.

DBeaver, by default, does not display system objects. To view the SYSTEM_ schema, users need to set the "Show system objects" option.

Click on [ Connection View ] → [ Show system objects ] option.

![sysschema1](media/DBeaver/sysschema1.png)

After reconnecting to the database, users will be able to see the tables and views in the SYSTEM_ schema.

![sysschema2](media/DBeaver/sysschema2.png)

![sysschema3](media/DBeaver/sysschema3.png)

####  The DDL output for the object is not accurate.

To retrieve the accurate DDL statements of Altibase objects, it is essential to install the DBMS_METADATA package by SYS user.

To install the DBMS_METADATA package, connect to Altibase using the SYS account and execute the following statement:

```
$ cd $ALTIBASE_HOME
$ is -f ./packages/dbms_metadata.sql
$ is -f ./packages/dbms_metadata.plb
```

Example)

The following is an example syntax for creating the queue object Q1.

   ```
CREATE QUEUE q1(40) MAXROWS 100000;
   ```

After executing the above statement and attempting to retrieve the DDL for the Q1 object in DBeaver, the wrong output may be displayed as follows. 

![ddl1](media/DBeaver/ddl1.png)

Install the DBMS_METADATA package:

```
$ cd $ALTIBASE_HOME
$ is -f ./packages/dbms_metadata.sql
$ is -f ./packages/dbms_metadata.plb
```

After installation, reconnect to the target Altibase in DBeaver. Users can retrieve accurate DDL statements for the Q1.

#### Microseconds in DATE type are not visible.

DBeaver's timestamp output format is 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS', displaying milliseconds (3 decimal places) in contrast to Altibase's DATE type, which can represent microseconds (6 decimal places).

The query results for DATE type data under the default settings of DBeaver are as follows.

![datetype1](media/DBeaver/datetype1.png)

To display the DATE type in microseconds, users need to change DBeaver's data type settings. The location for changing the settings is as follows.

Navigate to [ Windows ] → [ Preference ]

![datetype2](media/DBeaver/datetype2.png)

Navigate to [ Editors ] → [ Data Editor ] → [ Data Formats ] → Click on "Datasource settings"

![datetype3](media/DBeaver/datetype3.png)

Select the database connection and click [ Select ].

![datetype4](media/DBeaver/datetype4.png)

There are two methods to change the settings to view DATE type up to microseconds.

1. Change the data type Value Settings:

   Navigate to [ Datasource settings ]→ [ Format ], set the Type to Timestamp, change the Value to 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm.ss.SSSSSS', and then click [ Apply and Close ].

   ![datetype5](media/DBeaver/datetype5.png)

   When querying DATE type data, it displays a fixed six digits after the decimal point, including zero, as shown below.

   ![datetype6](media/DBeaver/datetype6.png)

2. Set the Data formats "Disable date/time formatting" option

   Click on [ Datasource settings ] → [ Settings ], check the "Disable date/time formatting" checkbox, then click on [ Apply and Close ].

#### "Invalid data type length" error message is displayed when modifying CHAR type.

DBeaver Data Editor defaults to executing INSERT statements when modifying data. Before saving the changes made with the Data Editor, ensure that the modified data does not exceed the column size.

![chartype1](media/DBeaver/chartype1.png)

#### I want to see Binary Data type as Hex.

DBeaver's default setting displays binary data as a String type. To view binary data as Hex, users need to change the setting.

![binarytype1](media/DBeaver/binarytype1.png)

Click on database connection.

#### Unable to Modify Binary Type Data in DBeaver Data Editor

To modify binary type data in DBeaver, users need to enter the data to be modified in the "Value" field of the Data Editor. Data directly entered into the cell of the grid is converted to the binary value and stored.

![binarytype6](media/DBeaver/binarytype6.png)

#### How does DBeaver handle BIT, VARBIT, and NIBBLE of Binary Data Types? 

In DBeaver, binary data is processed on a byte-unit basis. For binary data types such as BIT, VARBIT, and NIBBLE, which can be smaller than a byte, DBeaver handles them as numeric or character types inevitably.

#### How to completely delete DBeaver Settings and reinstall?

If users want to completely reset previous DBeaver settings and reinstall it, users need to completely remove the DBeaver application and user data before reinstalling.

Check the default DBeaver workspace folder location based on the operating system and remove all DBeaver data:

| OS      | Default location of DBeaver workspace                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows | `%APPDATE$\DBeaverData`                                      |
| MacOS   | `~/Library/DBeaverData/`                                     |
| Linux   | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/DBeaverData/` ($XDG_DATA_HOME=`~/.local/share` if not set) |
