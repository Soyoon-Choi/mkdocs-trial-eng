# 4. Functions

This chapter explains DIFF function and SYNC function in detail with examples.

This chapter consists of the following sections:

- Comparison (Diff) funtion
- Synchronization (SYNC) function

### Comparison (DIFF) Function

The comparison(DIFF) function verifies inconsistent records between Master DB and Slave DB by identifying the inconsistent records occurred during the replication execution between the two database system and recording them to a file.

#### Configuration File

Set the \<Options\> - \<Operation\> value in dataCompJ configuration file to "DIFF".

<Connections\> and <Options\> are required entries and target table should be described in <TablePairs\>.

##### dataCompJ.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<dataCompJ>
<Connections>
    <MasterDB>
        <JdbcUrl>jdbc:Altibase://192.168.1.94:21135/mydb</JdbcUrl>

<TablePairs>
    <TablePair>
        <MasterTable>EX1</MasterTable>
    </TablePair>      
</TablePairs>
</dataCompJ>
```

#### How to Execute Comparison(DIFF)

The comparison(DIFF) is executed with the following command.

```
$ dataCompJCli.sh -f dataCompJ.xml
```

#### Execution Result

As a result of the execution, a report file(dataCompJ_report.txt) in which the execution result is summarized and log files(dataCompJ.log, dataCompJ_data.log) in which the event is recorded during the execution are created. Such files are delineated in the "Output Files" in detail. 

The table structure used in the example is as follows.

```
CREATE TABLE ex1 (C1 int primary key, C2 varchar(20), C3 CLOB, C4 int);
```

##### DIFF Execution

MXSO    Slave only                            1
------------------------------------------------------

```

##### Executable Data File

Four following comma-separated values(CSV) format data files are created in a TablePair unit as a result of selecting the comparison(DIFF).

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_MASTER_diff.csv:  
    If MOSO is detected, this file stores the value of inconsistent record founds in the master table in CSV form.

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_SLAVE_diff.csv:  
    This file stores the value of inconsistent records found in the slave table due to MOSO inconsistency in CSV form.

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_MASTER_only.csv:  
    This file stores the value of records which only exist in the master table due to MOSX inconsistency in CSV form.

-   *SchemaName.TableName*\_SLAVE_only.csv:  
    This file stores the value of records which only exist in the slave table due to MXSO inconsistency in CSV form.

Since the inconsistent data due to MOSO inconsistency are recorded in the same order in in SchemaName.TableName_MASTER_diff.csv and SchemaName.TableName_SLAVE_diff.csv, when DIFF function is used to compare these files, user can intuitively compare the part MOSO inconsistency occurred.

#### Example

The table structure used for the examples is as follows.

```
CREATE TABLE ex1 (C1 int primary key, C2 varchar(20), C3 CLOB, C4 int); /* Unsupported data in C3 CLOB dataCompJ */
CREATE TABLE ex2 (C1 int primary key, C2 varchar(20), C3 int);
```

##### DIFF Example 1

This example demonstrates specifying or omitting the schema name for two target tables. 

In case of EX1 in the example below, <MasterTable\> entry describes only the table name without schema and <SlaveTable\> entry is omitted. The <MasterTable\> describing the table name only uses the value inserted in <MasterDB\>-\<UserId\> as its schema name. The omitted <SlaveTable\> is processed assuming that it has the same value with <MasterTable\>.

C3 column in EX1 table is automatically excluded from the comparison target since it is a CLOB type which is unsupported data type by dataCompJ, and this is recorded in candidate tables entry in the report. 

In EX2 table, the schema name and table name are specified by a user, and it is processed based on the inserted schema and table names.

##### DIFF Example 2

The following example shows that a user can specify certain columns in tables to exclude, and conduct comparison(Diff) on records meeting specified conditions (Where). 

User specifies to exclude C4 in non-primary key columns on EX1 table from the comparison targets in dataCompJ.xml, and execute comparison only for the records whose C1 column value is greater than 5.

------------------------------------------------------

```

### Synchronization(SYNC) Function

The Synchronization(SYNC) function identifies the inconsistent records occurred during the replication between the master DB and slave DB and applies them to the slave DB. This feature allows effective synchronization between the two database system.

#### Configuration Files

Set the \<Options\> - \<Operation\> value in dataCompJ configruration file to "SYNC".

<Connections\> and <Options\> are required entries and target table should be described in <TablePairs\>.

###### dataCompJ.xml

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<dataCompJ>
<Connections>
    <MasterDB>
        <JdbcUrl>jdbc:Altibase://192.168.1.94:21135/mydb</JdbcUrl>
...
        <UserId>sys</UserId>
...

    <SlaveDB>

<TablePairs>
    <TablePair>
        <MasterTable>EX1</MasterTable>
    </TablePair>      
</TablePairs>
</dataCompJ>
```

#### How to Execyte Synchronization(SYNC)

The Synchronization(SYNC) function is executed as in the following manner.

```
$ dataCompJCli.sh -f dataCompJ.xml
$ dataCompJCli.sh -f ./dataCompJ.xml

```

#### Execution Results

As a result of the execution, a report file(dataCompJ_report.txt) in which the execution result is summarized and log files(dataCompJ.log, dataCompJ_data.log) in which the event is recorded during the execution are created. Such files are delineated in the "Output Files" in detail.
