# 2. Startup and Shutdown Altibase

--------------------

This chapter explains how to start up and shut down Altibase after it has been properly installed. 

### Startup Altibase

The Altibase server can be started up in one of two ways: either using iSQL command 'startup' after accessing the sysdba administrator mode or using a shell script named "server start".

To explain the Altibase server startup process, first, the properties are read and system memory is checked, and then it initializes the Altibase system environment, system data, signal handling, the memory used for database space, the query processor, and the threads. This completes the Altibase server startup.

The command to startup Altibase can only be executed with the account that installed Altibase. The following shows how to run the database using iSQL utility (which is provided with the Altibase package). For more detailed information about starting Altibase, please refer to the *Administrator's Manual.* For more detailed information about the iSQL utility, please refer to the *iSQL User's Manual*.

Alternatively, the user can run the server using the server script command. For more detailed information on the server script, please refer to the *Utilities Manual.*

### Shutdown Altibase

The Altibase server can be shutdown using the server script command, or by using iSQL command 'shutdown' after accessing the sysdba administrator mode or using a shell script named "server stop".

Shutdown, a command to shut down a server has three options with each's own way of shutting down the server.

Altibase's shutdown command can be executed only with the account that installed Altibase.

#### Normal

In order for the server to shutdown normally, the server must first wait until all clients have disconnected. What server does when it exits is to terminate the thread that detects the client-server communication session, terminates the service thread, terminates the data storage manager, and waits for the Altibase server process to terminate completely. 

When the server is shut down in this way, the following message is output: 

```
iSQL(sysdba)> shutdown normal;
Ok..Shutdown Proceeding....

TRANSITION TO PHASE : Shutdown Altibase
  [RP] Finalization : PASS
shutdown normal success.
```



#### immediate

When the immediate shutdown option is used, before the server is shutdown, connected sessions are forcibly disconnected, then current transactions are forcibly rolled back.

The output for an immediate shutdown is as follow:

```
iSQL(sysdba)> shutdown immediate
Ok..Shutdown Proceeding....

TRANSITION TO PHASE : Shutdown Altibase
  [RP] Finalization : PASS
shutdown immediate success.
```

The server can also be forcibly shutdown using a server script command.

```
$ server stop

TRANSITION TO PHASE : Shutdown Altibase
  [RP] Finalization : PASS
shutdown immediate success.
```



#### abort

This option terminates the Altibase server with the system command 'kill -9'. When Altibase is shutdown in this way, the database may not be closed properly, and thus have to go through  the database recovery process the next time you run the Altibase server.

```
iSQL(sysdba)> shutdown abort
```



The server can also be forcibly shutdown using the server script command 'server kill'.

```
$ server kill
