# 1. Introduction

This chapter describes the background of the emergence of Hybrid DBMS. It also describes the structure and features of Altibase.

### Hybrid DBMS Concept

This chapter introduces the Hybrid Database Management System (Hybrid DBMS), a new concept pioneered by Altibase.

#### Background of Hybrid DBMS

The development of the hybrid DBMS is closely related to the characteristics of memory and disk, the two major types of data storage media used by DBMS.

First, the memory consists of electronic gates. The time required to access memory is only a few nanoseconds (ns, billionths of a second), and is relatively consistent. However, in the event of a power failure, all data in memory are lost. That is, memory is a volatile storage medium.

In contrast, a disk consists of a head arm and a platter. Disk access time is on the order of microsecond (us, millionths of a second), which is relatively slow compared to random access memory (RAM). Furthermore, access time can be inconsistent. Even SSDs (Solid State Drives), which have recently become more popular, have vastly inferior access time when compared to volatile memory.

However, the data on the disk are stored permanently, even in the event of a power failure.

Second, the memory is connected to the main board through the system bus, and its maximum capacity is determined by the specifications of the main board. If the main board has a 32-bit CPU installed, the maximum possible amount of memory is 4GB, whereas, at present, if a 64-bit CPU is installed in the main board, the theoretical maximum amount of memory is on the order of hundreds of gigabytes (that is, hundreds of billions of bytes). In contrast, disks are connected to the main board and the I/O bus. Thus, terabytes of disk space can be installed, regardless of the characteristics of the main board.

In summary, memory typically has hundreds of times faster access time and better performance than disk, while data is lost during power outages and has limited storage capacity. In contrast, the disk is permanently stored and have close to unlimited capacity, while access time is slow and inconsistent.

DBMSs can be categorized as one of two kinds, depending on the distinct characteristics of the two kinds of storage devices: Disk-Resident DBMSs (referred to as "DRDBMS"), which store data on the disk, and Main memory DBMSs (referred to as "MMDBMS"), which store data in the memory.

##### Emergence of DRDBMS

In the DRDBMS structure, data are stored on disk. The DRDBMS reads data from the data from the disk into a memory buffer and delivers it to the application program. 

In this structure, the application typically uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to access the data. One major advantage of DRDBMS is the use of concurrency control and recovery strategies to protect the data, which makes it much easier to develop applications. Moreover, because the data are stored on disk, high-capacity DBMSs can be configured. 

Because of these advantages, DRDBMSs have been widely used in various industrial fields.

However, there has been a great demand for data processing due to the rapid progress of informatization throughout many industries and increased the performance of information processing. Thus, due to problems of inadequate data processing speed and inconsistent data access time, DRDBMSs are unusable in an increasing number of fields.

Therefore, custom-designed memory DBs have been used in many industries, requiring high performance and uniform performance data processing. 

However, as such data processing products are universal, they have to be individually developed from scratch. This has had the undesirable consequences of increased maintenance and repair costs and decreased performance, integration, and scalability.



##### Emergence of MMDBMS

MMDBMS are structured such that data are stored in memory and the data in memory are read and sent directly to client applications.

This structure preserves the main advantages of DRDBMS, namely the ability to access data using standard SQL statements and to protect data via concurrency control and recovery, thereby making it easy to develop applications and share data. 

In addition, because MMDBMS store data in memory, in contrast with the DRDBMS (which store data on disk) the average processing speed is significantly fast and performance is consistent. These are inherent characteristics of memory that are assured. Therefore, MMDBMS are receiving attention in fields where fast and consistent performance are necessary but development and maintenance issues make it difficult to implement DRDBMS.

An MMDBMS can typically perform an update operation about 10 times quicker than a DRDBMS, and a search operation about 4 times quicker.

The reason that an update operation cannot be performed hundreds of times faster than when using a DRDBMS is that, like a DRDBMS, an MMDBMS must also write log files to disk in order to protect the data. Nevertheless, the update operation of MMDBMS is faster because the MMDBMS is optimized and simplified for data protection than DRDBMS.

Similarly, the reason that a search operation is not hundreds of times faster than when using a DRDBMS is that a DRDBMS also uses memory buffers to improve data access performance.

Nevertheless, search operations are faster using an MMDBMS because data access is simplified and optimized, and access times are consistent when accessing memory (that is,so-called “jitter” is eliminated).

Despite the advantages of high and consistent performance, because MMDBMS must save data in memory, they encounter a limitation when data processing requirements are a large volume and store more than hundreds of GB of data.

##### **Combining MMDBMS and DRDBMS**

To overcome these problems, the most commonly solution is to divide and store the data separately. The data that needs high performance is stored in the MMDBMS, and the data that needs large capacity is stored in the DRDBMS.

This structure encounters the following problems: information shared by the MMDBMS and DRDBMS must be synchronized, applications that must bi-directionally communicate with both the MMDBMS and DRDBMS must be connected with both of them at the same time, and error recovery is complicated.

However, until now, since there has been no other way to simultaneously realize high data processing performance and handle large amounts of data, this approach has generally been adopted in fields in which fast data access and voluminous data processing are both required.

##### Emergence of Hybrid DBMS

Hybrid DBMSs have emerged to take advantage of the strong points and to overcome the weak points of MMDBMS, DRDBMS, and combined MMDBMS/DRDBMS.

In a Hybrid DBMS, the data are separated, and stores the data that requires high performance in memory and the data that needs large capacity on disk. However, a single DBMS processes both kinds of data in a unified manner.

Because high-performance and voluminous data are both handled by a single DBMS, the aforementioned problems related to combined DBMSs, namely complicated error handling and the requirement for applications to be complicated, are solved. Furthermore, a Hybrid DBMS can be implemented as an MMDBMS, a DRDBMS, or a Hybrid DBMS.

To summarize, the Hybrid DBMS combines the advantages of the MMDBMS, which is optimized for processing high-performance data, and the DRDBMS, which is optimized for processing large amounts of data, because the data are classified and saved according to their characteristics, but handled in an integrated manner.

In other words, hybrid DBMS is capable of high-performance information processing by efficient use of time, and large-scale information processing by efficient resource utilization.  Hybrid DBMS can now be adopted in all fields, including those requiring both high performance and the processing of large amounts of data.

### Altibase Features

This section provides an overview of the components and functionalities of Altibase.

The basic features of Altibase, the high-performance, large-volume hybrid database system, will now be introduced. The characteristics, structure, function, etc., of Altibase are explained briefly here. For more detailed information, please refer to each of the separately published Altibase manuals.

#### Data Model

The Altibase data model is patterned after employs the relational model. The relational model includes the three following major concepts:

Database Structures- The objects that databases use to save and access data are referred to as tables, indexes, views, etc. These objects are the basic operational units.

Operations- Operations define what actions users are permitted to conduct data and database structures. Operations are related to integrity constraints.

Integrity- Integrity constraints are rules pertaining to which operations are permitted on data and structures, and serve to protect data and data structures.

Relational database management systems provide the following benefits:

-   Physical data management and logical data management are independent of each other. 

-   All data can be accessed easily and in a variety of ways.

-   Databases can be freely designed as desired.

-   Database storage space requirements and data redundancy are reduced.

#### Engine Structure

Altibase supports a client-server architecture. In the client-server architecture, the client accesses the server over a communications network, as with a traditional RDBMS.

The Altibase server has a multithreaded internal structure.

#### Interfaces

Unlike other real-time database systems, Altibase supports a wide range of industry-standard interfaces for maximum compatibility. The Altibase query language complies with the SQL92 and SQL99 standard, and also provides extended features.

Because Altibase supports ODBC, JDBC, and C/C++ Precompiler, it can be used without converting the existing database application in order to use them with Altibase Hybrid MMDBMS

#### **Multi-Version Concurrency Control**

Altibase manages concurrency using the MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control). MVCC is a technique of achieving maximum performance by eliminating collisions when reading and writing operations are performed on multiple versions of a single data item. 

In particular, this eliminates the problem of read operation placing a lock on data and causing a sub-sequent modify operation on that data to take a long time. This is a disadvantage of the conventional row locking mechanism. MVCC allows old and unnecessary data to be immediately removed, thereby preventing memory from being unnecessarily wasted. MVCC exhibits optimal performance in environments with large numbers of users, and supports "hot backup" systems, that is, databases in which backup operations can be performed at will without shutting the database down first.

Altibase provides MVCC in different ways for its memory table and disk tables in appearance, although this difference is imperceptible to the user. So-called “out-place MVCC” (where a new version of a record is created every time a record in a memory table is changed) is implemented for memory tables, whereas for disk tables, “in-place MVCC” (where new data are written over existing records and undo tablespaces are used to store and refer to previous versions of the data) is implemented.

#### Transaction Processing

The Altibase Hybrid DBMS architecture provides various features to achieve maximum performance. First, the number of transactions that can be simultaneously executed in the database can be controlled by configuring the properties in the altibase.properties file. Additionally, for efficient server operation, AUTOCOMMIT mode can be used. Furthermore, Altibase provides the following transaction isolation levels: “read committed” (0), “repeatable read” (1), and “no phantom read” (2), which can be selected appropriately depending on the user’s requirements.

#### **Logging**

For database stability and durability, Altibase logs to the contents of the changed database. In addition, the optimal log is created to maximize the performance of replication between systems.

#### Buffer Pool

To improve the performance of transactions that access disk tablespaces, disk I/O is minimized. This is accomplished using the buffer pool. Pages that have already been read from disk and cached in memory are prevented from being subsequently read from disk again. The buffer pool is managed by the Hot-Cold LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm.

#### Double Write Files

If the page size of the Altibase system is different the physical page size of the file system, and if the Altibase server terminates abnormally during the disk I/O, the page may be corrupted.

To avoid this, Altibase saves the same image to a "double-write file" on the disk and then saves the page back to its original location when the page is flushed. Furthermore, when the Altibase server is restarted, it compares the contents of the double-write file with that of the actual page, and restores any corrupted pages. 

The double write function compensates for disk errors, but can degrade the system's performance. This feature may not be used by the user for performance. 

#### Fuzzy & Ping Pong Checkingpoint

Altibase uses fuzzy & ping pong checkpoints to ensure that the latest database state is safely backed up. 

In the main memory database, fuzzy checkpointing stores all changed data pages in a backup database, and because transactions that are currently underway can have an effect thereon, fuzzy and ping-pong checkpointing methods are used together. That is, because two backup databases are maintained, the processing burden associated with the checkpointing process can be decreased, and optimum transaction performance can be realized.

#### Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is a database procedure that takes an input argument, an output argument, and an input/output argument and executes multiple SQL statements at once depending on conditions defined in the body.

The stored procedure is functionally classified as either a procedure or a function depending on whether it returns a value or not. Please refer to the [*Stored Procedure User's Manual*](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/Stored%20Procedures%20Manual.md) for more detailed information.

#### Deadlock Detection

Deadlock is a state in which transactions wait for each other to release the locked resources that they require. To deal with such cases, conventional DBMS has a separate thread or process which detects and handles such deadlocks. This kind of detection structure inevitably results in a temporary service interruption. Altibase does not have a separate deadlock detection thread. Instead, a deadlock is detected at the instant it occurs, and Altibase immediately takes steps to prevent service interruption depending on the case, in order to guarantee stable and continuous database operation.

#### Table Compaction

When a database is running, it is possible for a particular memory table to occupy more memory than it actually requires. This often happens when previously inserted data are updated or deleted. In these cases, it would be more efficient if the memory not needed by the table in question could be returned to the system. To meet this need, Altibase provides a memory table compaction function. Using this function, memory and tables can be more efficiently managed.

#### **Database Replication**

Altibase provides log-based database replication to realize both high availability and fault tolerance. This log-based replication system construction, in which database replication is conducted based on transaction logs, increases the efficiency of Altibase and decreases the load on the system. A replication management thread on a local system, which is currently operating, sends local transaction logs to a replication management thread on a remote system in real time. The replication management thread on the remote system analyzes the received log data and passes them to the Altibase server, which implements the changes in the database. In this way, a system can be provided in which, when normal operation of one of the servers is interrupted, service can be immediately restored without downtime.

Altibase also provides a load-balancing feature. In the replicated Altibase database environment, user transactions can be divided into two or more groups. Each group of transactions is executed on a corresponding server, and changes on one server are reflected on the other servers automatically. In this way, data consistency between the servers is ensured.

#### Client-Server Protocol

When running Altibase in a client-server architecture, a user can select and use a client-server protocol suitable for the configuration of the application system. The communication protocols that Altibase supports are TCP/IP, IPC, IPCDA and Unix domain socket.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the protocol that is most commonly used between clients and servers over a network. The IPC(Inter-Process Communication) protocol provided by Altibase, which supports communication between client and server by using shared memory. Because the IPC uses shared memory, marshaling of communication packets is not needed, acceleration of high speed communication is technically feasible compared to other protocols. 

IPCDA is designed to maximize performance by minimizing the IPC-based communication method. The IPCDA enables direct reading and writing to shared memory in order to minimize memory access. Moreover, idle time in each process is minimized by using spinlock, which was originally developed by Altibase.

When the client application and Altibase are on different systems, TCP/IP, which uses Internet sockets, must be used, whereas, when they are on the same system, the Unix domain socket protocol or the IPC, IPCDA protocol can also be used. IPCDA offers the fastest performance of these communication protocols, followed by IPC, Unix domain socket, and then TCP/IP. However, LOB data is not supported in IPCDA.

For more detailed information on server and client communication, please refer to ‘Server/Client Communication’.

#### **Database Space**

Altibase database consists of all of the data in the database stored in one or more tablespaces. The tablespaces are divided into memory tablespaces and disk tablespaces. 

Besides the system tablespace (which is created by Altibase), a user can add memory and disk tablespaces.

#### Direct-Path INSERT

Direct-Path INSERT inserts data by creating a new page instead of searching for empty space on the existing pages. That is, instead of using the table’s free space when entering data, a new extent is allocated from the tablespaces.

Moreover, because INSERT can be used in the same manner as APPEND, the number of redo and undo operations is reduced, and thus logging expenses are reduced.

#### Database Link

Database Link unites disparate data sources on interconnected servers to produce a single unified result, even if the data are stored in different kinds of data servers that are physically far apart from one another.

#### iSQL

The users can manage their databases quickly and easily using iSQL (the Altibase interactive SQL command utility).

#### altiComp

The altiComp feature compares and examine the tables of two databases, to output information about mismatching data and synchronize the databases.

#### iLoader

Altibase provides an iLoader utility that allows users to download or upload data on a table-by-table basis when moving a database or backing up a table.

### Structure of Altibase

This section describes the Altibase internal server processing structure and database structure based on the client-server structure of Altibase.

#### Overall Structure

The following figure shows a client-server system composed of Altibase and an application. The Altibase server component is displayed in a layered architecture to show the path in which client requests and data are processed. Other components are drivers and libraries for accessing applications and databases. 

![](media/Admin/5b4f61bb20483a11698ec2dbf7600cfb.png)

[Figure 1-2] The Structure of the Altibase Server

#### **Internal Structure of Server Process**

The internal structure of an Altibase server process consists of the main thread, the dispatcher, the load balancer, the service thread pool, the service thread, the checkpoint thread, the garbage collection thread, the log flush thread, the buffer flush thread, and the archivelog thread. Each thread performs the function described below:

##### **Main Thread**

The main thread creates/shuts down all threads and manage created threads.

##### Dispatcher

When a client requests a connection, the dispatcher connects the requesting client with the service thread that is available in the service thread pool.

##### Load Balancer

The load balancer detects the overload of each services, add or remove service threads, and distributes tasks to service threads. 

**Service Thread Pool**

Altibase creates and manages service threads for query processing and pools them in the Service Thread Pool. The number of service threads that are created corresponds to the user config- uration at the time the server was started.

**Service Thread**
The service thread processes queries and returns the result to the client. When the Altibase server starts up, Altibase creates and stores as many service threads in the service thread pool as specified in the configuration (altibase.properties) information. 

**Checkpoint Thread**

To reduce the amount of work required when recovering from a failure, the checkpoint thread records information about the current status of the database and the system in data files. Both manual checkpointing and automatic (periodic) checkpointing are available.

**Session Management Thread (Session Manager)**

The session management thread monitors the status of the connected session between the client and the service thread, that is, it monitors whether a given session has been interrupted.

**Garbage Collection Thread (Ager)

Using MVCC can cause old and unnecessary data to remain in memory. As soon as some data becomes unnecessary, the garbage collection thread recovers memory space so that it can be reused, in order to maximize the efficiency of memory usage. The garbage collection thread is also called the ager.

**Log Flush Thread**

The log flush thread maintains the logs that are created in response to every transaction that occurs in a database, and it updates large amounts of log data gathered in the log buffer to the log files on disk. These completely synchronized logs are used to ensure safe recovery in the event that the database system fails or a disaster occurs.

**Buffer Flush Thread (Flusher)

If all of the memory in the buffer pool is in use, disk I/O becomes inevitable and this can cause performance inconsistencies (“jitter”) on the transactions that are underway. The buffer flush thread regularly checks the buffer, always maintains a certain amount of available buffer memory, and flushes unused pages to disk, so that memory can be reused. The buffer flush thread is also called the flusher.

**Archivelog Thread**
The Archievelog thread regularly copies online log files to a predefined destination for use in recovery from storage media errors. The destination path is specified in the ARCHIVE_DIR property in the altibase.properties file. This feature works only when the database is in archive log mode.

[Figure 1-3] Internal Structure of an Altibase Server Process

#### Physical Database Structure

Altibase database physically consists of log anchor files, log files, and data files.

**Log Anchor Files**

Log anchor files contain critical information indicating the relationship between files and transaction logs. They contain general information about the state of data files at specific points in time based on transaction log timestamps. These files must be backed up along with data files in order for database recovery to be possible.

**Log Files**

Log files, also known as “redo log files”, are used to maintain the atomicity and durability of transactions. Atomicity is the ability to return to the state that existed before a transaction by rolling back the transaction. Durability is the ability to restore a database to its original state, which reflects the result of all recently properly committed transactions, in the event of a database fault.

Log files are categorized into prepare log files, active log files and archive log files depending on their contents. A log file which is used to write current transaction logs is called an active log file. A prepare log file is an empty log file which is prepared in advance in order to increase the speed with which logs are written. An archive log file is a backup of a log file which is no longer being written to, but which is kept available for recovery purposes.

Log files are very important because they record the current status of the database. If a current log file should become damaged, the entire database will be damaged, regardless of whether or not a transaction was underway at the time, the log file was damaged. Log files are typically used in conjunction with backup files to restore the database in the event that data files become damaged.

##### Data Files

By default, the created system memory tablespace is saved in SYS_TBS_MEM_DATA, whereas the meta tables and the created disk tablespace are saved in SYS_TBS_MEM_DIC and system001.dbf, respectively. Moreover, the intermediate results of queries that are currently being executed are saved in temp001.dbf, and previous image information, which is used for MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) is saved in the undo file undo001.dbf.

Altibase manages files for storing data on the basis of pages. All data files consist of data pages, which are the smallest unit used by databases.

Pages are categorized into catalog pages, which contain information for managing the database, and data pages, which contain user data. Catalog pages contain detailed information about the current database, and are used to maintain information about changes and consistency checks, which are conducted when Altibase is started up and shut down.

Catalog pages contain lists and information about the use of the other data pages in the database. They are the first pages that can be found in backup databases, and are very important pages.

Actual user data are stored in data pages. Each data page consists of a page header and a page body. A page header consists of link and type information, used to maintain a list of pages, as well as a page identification number. A page body is divided into a number of slots, in which the actual data are ultimately stored.

#### Logical Database Structure

Altibase logically stores data in memory and disk tablespaces, and physically in data files that correspond to these tablespaces.

Each tablespace that makes up an Altibase database consists of one or more data files. However, a data file can only be associated with a single tablespace.

A database and its tablespaces and data files are intimately related as follows:

A database logically consists of one or more storage units known as tablespaces. Tablespaces are logical space in which all of the data in a database are saved. A database physically consists of one or more files called data files. That is to say, data files are the physical space in which all of the data in a database are stored.

The following figure describes the relationship between tablespaces and data files.

![](media/Admin/1-4.png)

[Figure 1-4] The Logical Structure of a Database

Altibase allocates tablespaces – logical database areas – to all of the data in a database. The units of allocation of physical database space are pages, extents and segments.

A page is the smallest unit of logical storage. Altibase stores all data in pages.

The next logical step up from a page is an extent. That is, an extent consists of a particular number of consecutive pages.

The next logical database storage area up from an extent is called a segment. Each segment is a set of extents, and all extents in one segment are stored in the same tablespace.

For more detailed information, please refer to [Chapter 6: Managing Tablespaces.](#6-managing-tablespaces)

##### Boot Log File (altibase_boot.log)

The Altibase server records information about the booting status in this file. Because this file is written to every time Altibase is started up and shut down, detailed system information is available., In addition, when Altibase shuts down abnormally, this file provides clues about the error state.

##### Property File (altibase.properties)

This file is the Altibase server environment configuration file, and contains all of the information pertaining to how the Altibase server is executed and tweaked.

##### Error Message Files

This file contains error messages related to the data storage management module, the query processor module, and the Altibase server main module, as well as those related to function execution and data type.
