# 7. SQL Plan Cache
--------------

This chapter describes the concepts and features of Altibase's SQL Plan Cache and Result Cache features.

### Overview of the SQL Plan Cache

Altibase uses the SQL plan cache to share SQL execution plans necessary for executing SQL statements among sessions. Whenever a shared SQL plan is executed, the execution context can be reused and performance enhancement can be anticipated. 

#### Structure of the SQL Plan Cache 

![sql_plan_cache](media/TuningGuide/sql_plan_cache.gif)

[Figure 7-1] Structure of the SQL Plan Cache

Altibase has cache areas that are shared by all sessions. These cache areas comprise the SQL plan cache, the stored procedure cache and the meta cache. The information stored and shared in each cache is as follows:

-   Shared SQL Plan Cache  
    Whenever new SQL execution plans are created, they are stored in the SQL plan cache so that they can be shared by all sessions.
    
-   Stored Procedure Cache  
    Whenever new stored procedure execution plans are created, they are stored in the stored procedure cache so that they can be shared.
    
-   Meta Cache  
    Meta data (information about database objects) is stored in the meta cache so that it can be accessed quickly.

#### Advantages of the SQL Plan Cache

The use of the Altibase SQL Plan Cache confers the following advantages:

-   Cost reduction in preparing and improved performance in direct execution environments Direct execution is the most basic way to execute a statement. In environments where queries are directly executed because plans that have already been prepared can be shared and reused, the cost of preparing execution plans can be reduced.
    
-   Drastic reduction of prepare memory in prepared execution environments Prepared execution is a way to reduce the parsing and compiling overhead associated with repeatedly executing a SQL statement. Moreover, in environments that use prepared execution only, the SQL plan cache confers not only the benefit of reducing the cost of preparing, but also the benefit of reducing the total amount of prepare memory that is required.
    
-   Check-in method.

-   Replacement policy which considers the number of times and the frequency with which plans are referred to.

### Managing the SQL Plan Cache

Altibase uses a plan-sharing-oriented check-in method. The SQL plan cache has a replacement policy which considers not only which plans were most recently referred to, but also the frequency with which plans are referred to. Thus, it is necessary to modify the property according to its purpose of use..

#### SQL Plan Cache Policies 

-   Execution plans within the size specified for SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE are registered.   
    Altibase registers new shared execution plans (within the total size specified for the SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE property) to the SQL plan cache. If a new plan is registered and the limit is exceeded, obsolete plans are searched for and deleted to make space for the new plan. The default value for the SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE property is 64MB and it is modifiable.
    
-   Referenced execution plans cannot be deleted.  
    SQL plan cacheâ€™s replacement policy takes into account the most recently and frequently referenced execution plans. Additionally, when the cache becomes sparse, the most frequently referenced plan cache objects are protected. If a new plan is registered and the limit specified for the SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE property is not only exceeded but the plans within the SQL plan cache are being referenced by other statements, no execution plan within the cache can be deleted. In this case, a new plan fails to be registered to the SQL plan cache and the CACHE_IN_FAIL_COUNT value in the V$SQL_PLAN_CACHE performance view increases.

#### Controlling the SQL Plan Cache

By default, the Altibase server adheres to a replacement policy and automatically manages execution plans. However, the DBA can manually manage execution plans when necessary.

The following statement is a control statement which uses the ALTER SYSTEM statement to initialize the SQL Plan Cache.

-   ALTER SYSTEM COMPACT SQL_PLAN_CACHE;  
    Deletes unused execution plans from the SQL Plan Cache.

-   ALTER SYSTEM RESET SQL_PLAN_CACHE;  
    Deletes unused execution plans from the SQL Plan Cache and initializes statistics.

For more detailed information about each SQL statement, please refer to the *SQL Reference.*

#### Statements that Use the SQL Plan Cache

Not all statements have their execution plans stored in the SQL plan cache. Altibase stores new execution plans of the following statements in the SQL plan cache and all sessions share them. For further information about each statement, please refer to the *SQL Reference.*

-   SELECT (SELECT FOR UPDATE)

-   INSERT (INSERT SELECT)

-   UPDATE

-   DELETE

-   MOVE

-   ENQUEUE

-   DEQUEUE

#### SQL Plan Cache-related Properties

To use the SQL plan cache, it is necessary to modify the values of some of the properties in the altibase.properties file accordingly. The properties that are related to the SQL plan cache are as follows. For more detailed information about each property, please refer to the *General Reference*.

-   SQL_PLAN_CACHE_BUCKET_CNT  
    The number of buckets in the hash table.

-   SQL_PLAN_CACHE_HOT_REGION_LRU_RATIO  
    The percentage of a hot area in an LRU list in an SQL plan cache to which frequently referenced execution plans are saved.
    
-   SQL_PLAN_CACHE_PREPARED_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_CNT  
    The number of execution contexts initially created when execution plans are generated.

-   SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE  
    The maximum size of the SQL Plan Cache.

#### SQL Plan Cache-related Performance Views

SQL plan cache-related performance views provide information on the SQL plan cache. For more detailed information about the columns in the performance views, please refer to the General Reference. 

-   V\$SQL_PLAN_CACHE_PCO  
    Displays information of plan cache objects.

-   V\$SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SQLTEXT  
    Displays information of the SQL statements registered in the plan cache. The user can join this performance view tih V$SQL_PLAN_CACHE_PCO to see how much a SQL statement is being used.

#### Restrictions

To reuse an execution plan registered in the SQL Plan Cache, the statement and parameter values of the SQL statement must be identical. Since the SQL Plan Cache was implemented to eliminate parsing costs, the Altibase server assumes SQL statements with non-identical parameter values as different statements.

For example, the SQL Plan Cache assumes tthat the following two statements are different.

```
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES(1,2);
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES(2,3);
```

To reuse execution plans registered in the SQL Plan Cache and enhance performance, a SQL statement must be written as below.

```
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES(? , ?)
```



#### Example

\<Query 1\> Output how many times execution plans in the SQL Plan Cache have been reused.

```
iSQL> SELECT max_cache_size, cache_hit_count, cache_miss_count 
        FROM V$SQL_PLAN_CACHE;
MAX_CACHE_SIZE CACHE_HIT_COUNT CACHE_MISS_COUNT
-------------------------------------------------------------
67108864          67288             769437
```

If the percentage for CACHE_MISS_COUNT is higher than CACHE_HIT_COUNT, the user is recommended to increase SQL_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE or change to a prepare-execute environment.

<Query 2> Output the reason why execution plans in the SQL Plan Cache are not reused and newly generated.

```
iSQL> SELECT create_reason, count(*) FROM v$sql_plan_cache_pco
        GROUP BY create_reason;
CREATE_REASON                 COUNT
------------------------------------------------------
CREATED_BY_CACHE_MISS         1241
CREATED_BY_PLAN_TOO_OLD       32
CREATED_BY_PLAN_INVALIDATION  16
```

If the value for CREATE_BY_CACHE_MISS is high, it is possible that the size for SQL Plan Cache is small or literal SQL has been highly used.

If the value for CREATE_BY_PLAN_INVALIDATION is high, it is possible that object definitions (tables, indexes) have been changed frequently.

\<Query 3> Output how many times execution plans in the SQL plan cache have been used.

```
iSQL> SELECT sql_text, child_pco_count, hit_count, rebuild_count
        FROM v$sql_plan_cache_sqltext a , v$sql_plan_cache_pco b 
        WHERE a.sql_text_id = b.sql_text_id 
        ORDER BY 2 DESC;
 SQL_TEXT            CHILD_PCO_COUNT     HIT_COUNT     REBUILD_COUNT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
select * from t1   8                        0               7  
```

If the Value for CHILD_PCO_COUNT is high, the user should check whether the SQL is the same but the object owners are different, or whether the referenced object is frequently changed.

### Overview of the Result Cache

The Result Cache is a function retrieving intermediate or final results of the initially executed query that are stored in the server when a query identical to the initial query is executed.

Altibase supports the Result Cache in which the intermediate result can be reused, and the Top Result Cache, which can also reuse the final results.

#### Result Cache Concept

The execution plan(execution plan, plan tree) of intermediate result should be stored in the server in order to omit the subordinate execution plan of the identical query, which might be executed once more for the next time. But the related tables must stay the same with the stored execution plan. Rerun the query, and discard the stored values in the server if the Execution plan possible to use Result Cache are as follows.

###### **Execution Plan with Result Cache enabled**

| Execution Plan    | Contents                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| SORT              | Order by, Join, Group by |
| DISTINCT          | Distinct                 |
| MATERIALIZATION   | View, Connect by         |
| GROUP-AGGREGATION | Group Aggregation        |
| GROUP-CUBE        | Group by cube            |
| GROUP-ROLLUP      | Group by rollup          |
| HASH              | Join                     |
| SET-DIFFERENCE    | Minus                    |
| SET-INTERSECT     | Intersect                |
| WINDOW-SORT       | Over clause              |
| LIMIT-SORT        | Limit                    |

#### Top Result Cache Concept

If you add an execution plan with stored final result of query to existing execution plan and store it to the server; then, the subordinate execution plan can be omitted. 

The tables related to the stored execution plan must remain the same in order to use Result Cache. Rerun the query, and discard the values stored in the server If the related tables are modified.

  Cache intermediate results by aligning T1 table with i1.  

  ```
  SELECT /*+ RESULT_CACHE */ * FROM T1 ORDER BY i1;
  ```

- TOP_RESULT_CACHE  
   Cache the final results by aligning T1 table with i1

  ```
  SELECT /*+ TOP_RESULT_CACHE */ * FROM T1 ORDER BY i1;
  ```


#### Result Cache-related Hints

Some of the properties in the altibase.properties file should be appropriately modified to serve the purpose. Refer to the *General Reference* for detailed information on each property

-   RESULT_CACHE_ENABLE  
    This property sets the Result_Cache function available for use.

-   RESULT_CACHE_MEMORY_MAXIMUM  
    This property sets the maximum of storage memory when using the Result Cache and Top Result Cache.

-   TOP_RESULT_CACHE_MODE  
    This property sets the caches which the final result of a query is available for use.

#### Restrictions

The restrictions in which you cannot use the Result Cache are in the followings.

-   The Result Cache cannot be used in the functions specified below.  
    Non-deterministic Function, RANDOM, RANDOM_STRING, SYS_GUID, SYS_GUID_STR, SYSDATE, SYSTIMESTAMP, UNIX_DATE, UNIX_TIMESTAMP
