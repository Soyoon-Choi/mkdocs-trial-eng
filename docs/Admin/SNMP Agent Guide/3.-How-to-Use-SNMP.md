# 3. How to Use SNMP

-------------

### SNMP Commands

SNMP receives network information either when there is a request or a significant event occurs. 

SNMP is an asynchronous protocol that communicates on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and only performs the following four simple operations. 

#### SNMP GET

SNMP GET retrieves a certain OID value from the SNMP agent. The basic information used for this operation is the server address (or name) or community name (for privileges) of the server on which the agent is installed, and the OID number or MIB hierarchy name.

#### SNMP WAK

SNMP WAK retrieves the next OID of a certain OID from the SNMP agent. This is usually called in series to retrieve all the OIDs under a certain OID. 

#### SNMP SET

SNMP SET changes the value of a certain OID. 

#### SNMP TRAP

SNMP TRAP notifies that a significant event has occurred. Traps are used to notify asynchronous events.
