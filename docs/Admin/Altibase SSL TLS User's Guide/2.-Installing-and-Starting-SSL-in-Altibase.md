# 2. Installing and Starting SSL in Altibase

This chapter explains how to use SSL and the required software.

### Software Requirements

This section describes the requirements for using SSL communication on the server and client.

#### Server

-   OpenSSL toolkit 0.9.4~1.0.2 
-   Altibase version 6.5.1 or later (only supports Intel-Linux)

The OpenSSL toolkit is a prerequisite for using SSL/TLS in Altibase. The OpenSSL toolkit was developed by the OpenSSL Project and can be downloaded from http://www.openssl.org/source. You should verify that the installed OpenSSL version is not vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug.

The user can use the OPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS option to check whether or not it is infected. 

#### Client

##### ODBC, CLI, ADO.NET

The OpenSSL toolkit has to be installed in order to use SSL communication with ODBC, CLI or ADO.NET.

##### JDBC

It is recommended to use Java Runtime Environment 1.6 (JRE1.6) or above to conveniently implement the client Java application through SSL. JRE 1.6 or above is recommended for a following reason (JRE 1.5 is also available for use, but not recommended):

-   Only JRE 1.6 or above supports importing the client’s certificate into the keystore (Note that importing the certificate is not always required.).

### Configuring the Environment for SSL Usage

This section discusses how to configure the environment for Altibase SSL.

-   [Configure SSL on the Server](#Configure-SSL-on-the-Server)

-   [Configure SSL for JDBC](#Configure-SSL-for-JDBC)

-   [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI](#Configure-SSL-for-ODBCCLI)

-   [Configure SSL for ADO.NET](#Configure-SSL-for-ADONET)

#### Configure SSL on the Server

-   Step 1: Confirm the Installation of OpenSSL and its library
-   Step 2: Set Server Properties to Connect over SSL
-   Step 3: Specify SSL Client Authentication
-   Step 4: Set Server Certificate, Private Key, and Certificate Authority
-   Step 5: Start the Server

##### Step 1: Confirm the Installation of OpenSSL and its Library

It is recommended to install the OpenSSL toolkit before installing SSL-enabled Altibase. If an Altibase function is used and OpenSSL is not installed, Altibase reports that it is unable to find the OpenSSL library.

Verify that OpenSSL is installed on the server and that it is not infected with the Heartbleed bug. If necessary, install it with the package manager provided by the operating system (e.g., RPM, Red Hat Linux) or download it from http://www.openssl.org/source and compile it manually. 

After installation, check the installed OpenSSL version as follows.

```
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.7e-fips-rhel5 01 Jul 2008
```

##### Step 2: Set Server Properties to Connect over SSL

The following are properties that you need to set to connect over SSL within Altibase. These properties are located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf file. For more detailed information about these properties, please refer to the *General Reference*.

-   SSL_ENABLE  
    : Switches the SSL feature on or off within Altibase. To enable, set the value to 1. 
-   SSL_PORT_NO  
    : Specifies the listening port number for SSL connections. The value must be unique. 
-   SSL_MAX_LISTEN  
    : Sets the listen queue maximum size for concurrent SSL connections. You should note that more listeners require more memory.
-   SSL_CIPHER_LIST  
    : The candidate cipher algorithm list available for the server and client to use and negotiate with. Depending on your security policy, you can specify one or more cipher names and separate them by colons. You can check the list at OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/) or execute the following command in the shell environment.

```
$ openssl ciphers
```

##### Step 3: Specify SSL Client Authentication

-   SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION  
    : Sets the SSL authentication mode to server-only authentication or mutual authentication. If the user sets the value to 1 for mutual authentication, the server will request a certificate from the client during the SSL handshake.

##### Step 4: Set Server Certificate, Private Key, and Certificate Authority

-   SSL_CERT

-   SSL_KEY

-   SSL_CA

-   SSL_CAPATH

###### SSL_CERT

Sets the server certificate path.

For example, if the name of a server certificate is server-cert.pem and it is located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/cert directory, the value for this property is ?/cert/server-cert.pem.

###### SSL_KEY

Sets the server private (secret) key path.

For example, if the name of a server’s secret key is server-key.pem and it is located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/cert directory, the value for this property is ?/cert/server- key.pem.

###### SSL_CA, SSL_CAPATH

The SSL_CA or SSL_CAPATH property must be set in order to receive ownership of the CA certificate issued by an accredited authority. The CA certificate file is located in a user-specified path or a directory in X.509 format.

If you don’t have an accredited certificate, you can use SSL by creating a private certificate. 

##### Step 5: Start the Server

Start SSL-enabled Altibase. Please refer to the sample files provided in the Appendix.

If SSL_ENABLE is set to 1, the SSL listen port is displayed as follows. This means that both the environment variables ALTIBASE_PORT_NO and ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO need to be defined. 

```
$server start

#### Configure SSL for JDBC

-   Step 1: Import Certificates

-   Step 2: Set up Authentication in a Java Environment

-   Step 3: Set JDBC Properties for SSL

-   Step 4: Set Altibase Environment Variables

##### Step 1: Import Certificates

The first step is to import certificates into the truststore for the server's CA certificate or into the keystore for its own CA certificate and secret key. Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) uses the truststore and keystore for authentication.

The next step to take depends on whether the CA certificate type is public or private and the job thereafter depends on whether the chosen authentication mode is server-only authentication or mutual authentication.

1.  Private certificates with server-only authentication mode:  
    Import the server's CA certificate into the truststore.

2.  Private certificates with mutual authentication mode:  
    Import the server's CA certificate into the truststore. Import the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own CA certificate and secret key, into the keystore.
    
3.  Public certificates with server-only authentication mode:  
    No action is necessary.

4.  Public certificates with mutual authentication mode:  
    Import the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own CA certificate and secret key, into the keystore.

When using private certificates (1 or 2 above), import the server's CA certificate into the truststore.

```
$keytool -import -alias alias_name -file server_certificate_file.pem -keystore truststore -storepass password
```

For 2 or 4, prior to importing its certificate and secret key, ensure that the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own certificate and secret key, is ready and that the Java version is 1.6 or above. 

If the PKCS #12 file is not ready, execute OpenSSL with the pkcs12 option to generate the PKCS #12 file which contains the client's certificate and secret key as follows.

```
$openssl pkcs12 -export -in client_certificate.pem -inkey client_secretkey_file.pem > pkcs_file.p12
```

Import the prepared PKCS #12 file into the keystore with the following options. <sup>1</sup>

[<sup>1</sup>] You can only import .pem files into keystore with the '-importkeystore' option in Java 6 or above.

```
$keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore pkcs_file.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -srcstoretype pkcs12
```

##### Step 2: Set up Authentication in a Java Environment

JRE must access the truststore and keystore for authentication over SSL. The user can select from any of the following three configurations.

-   Configure a Java Application's Command-line Option

-   Use the System.setProperty Method in a Java Application

-   Configure the JDBC Property in a Java Application 

###### Configure a Java Application’s Command-line Option

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path_to_keystore
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path_to_truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password
```

###### Use the System.setProperty Method in a Java Application

```
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", "path_to_keystore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword", "password");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "path_to_truststore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "password");
```

###### Configure the JDBC Property in a Java Application

```
Properties sProp = new Properties();
sProps.put("keystore_url", "path_to_keystore");
sProps.put("keystore_password", "password");
sProps.put("truststore_url", "path_to_truststore");
sProps.put("truststore_password", "password");
```

##### Step 3: Set JDBC Properties for SSL

Altibase provides JDBC for SSL connection to use SSL within the database. JDBC properties are categorized into the following two groups:

-   JDBC Properties for SSL Connections

-   JDBC Properties for Authentication

###### JDBC Properties for SSL Connections

| Name             | Description                                                  | Range          | Default Value                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ssl_enable       | Specifies whether or not to connect to the database over SSL connection. An SSL connection is created if this value is true; a TCP connection is created if this value is false. | true<br/>false | false                                                        |
| port             | Specifies the SSL port number on the target server. The priority for the SSL port number is: 1) if ssl_enable is true and a value has been specified, this value is applied first. 2) if ssl_enable is true and this value is omitted, the ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO environment variable is applied. 3) if ssl_enable is true and both this value and the ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO environment variable are omitted, the default value (20300) is applied. | 0 \~ 65535     | ssl_enable(false): 20300<br/>ssl_enable(true): 20443         |
| ciphersuite_list | This is a list of available ciphers. Each name is separated by a colon (e.g., SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5:SSL _RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA). If JRE does not support the named algorithm, an IllegalArgumentException with the "Unsupported ciphersuite" message is thrown. | String         | [All cipher suite lists supported by JRE](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html) |

###### JDBC Properties for Authentication

| Name                      | Description                                                  | Range                   | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| verify_server_certificate | Specifies whether or not to authenticate the target server's CA certificate. To use SSL exception authentication, set as false and the client application will not authenticate the server's CA certificate. In this case, it is unnecessary to import the server's private CA certificate for authentication. | true<br/>false          | true          |
| keystore_url              | Specifies the path to the keystore (a container for its own private key and the certificates with their corresponding public keys). | String                  |               |
| keystore_type             | Specifies the keystore type for keystore_url. Java Key Store (JKS) is the most common type in Java. | JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, etc | JKS           |
| keystore_password         | Specifies the password for keystore_url.                     | String                  |               |
| truststore_url            | Specifies the path to the truststore (a keystore containing certificates that belong to the communication partners). | String                  |               |
| truststore_type           | Specifies the truststore type at truststore_url above. Java Key Store (JKS) is the most common type in Java. | JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, etc | JKS           |
| truststore_password       | Specifies the password to truststore_url above.              | String                  |               |

##### Step 4: Set Altibase Environment Variables

Altibase sets the port number for SSL communication, and this step can be omitted. 

If the port property has not been set for JDBC, the value specified for ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO will be used as the port number. If ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO is omitted, the default value for the port property is used. 

| Name                 | Description                                         | Range         | Default Value |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO | Specifies the SSL port number on the target server. | 1024 \~ 65535 |               |

##### Considerations When Using SSL with JDBC

Please consider the following when using SSL for JDBC.

###### Importing the PKCS #12 File into the Keystore (Available for JRE 1.6. or later)

To use mutual authentication over SSL, you must first import the client's CA certificate and private key into the KeyStore. At this time, the supported version is JRE1.6 or higher. This is because, in Java 6 or higher, you can use the importkeystore option to send a pem file to the keystore.

However, after importing PKCS only once in JRE1.6 or later, JRE1.5 can be used. In other words, only the import process requires JRE1.6, and the mutual authentication function itself also works in 1.5.

```
$keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore pkcs_file.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks
-srcstoretype pkcs12
```

####  Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI

-   Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

-   Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

-   Step 3:  Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL

-   Step 4: Write a Client Program

##### Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

ODBC and CLI read the OpenSSL library and call the necessary functions while connecting to the server using SSL communication. Therefore, you should verify that the OpenSSL library has been installed properly, before writing a client application. Where the library is installed can differ among operating systems.

-   Verify the library installation

```
$ ls -al /usr/lib/libssl*
$ ls -al /usr/lib/libcrypto*
```

-   Verify the utility installation

```
$ openssl version
```

##### Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

Prepare the client’s certificate and secret key in a PEM format file for mutual authentication of the server and client. The location of these files should be accessible by a client using ODBC or CLI.

##### Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL

SSL properties must be set appropriately, before writing a client program using SSL. The client can specify the following properties as a connection string when connecting to the server. 

SSL connection properties are located in $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf. 

| Name       | Description                                                  | Range            | Default Value |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| SSL_CA     | Specifies the file path to store CA certificates to certify the ownership of received certificates. CA certificates can exist in a user-specific file path or a X.509 structured directory.<br/>Ex) SSL_CA= /cert/ ca-cert.pem. |                  |               |
| SSL_CAPATH | Specifies CAPATH in a CA directory format.<br/>Ex) SSL_CAPATH=/etc/ssl/certs |                  |               |
| SSL_CERT   | Sets the Altibase certificate path.</br>Ex) SSL_CERT=/cert/client-cert.pem |                  |               |
| SSL_KEY    | Sets the server private (secret) key path. <br/>Ex) SSL_KEY=/cert/client-key.pem |                  |               |
| SSL_VERIFY | Sets whether or not to authenticate the server certificate. An SSL handshake fails if authentication fails, and it becomes impossible to communicate over SSL. <br/>0(OFF): Does not authenticate the server certificate <br/>1(ON): Authenticates the server certificate<br/>Ex) SSL_VERIFY=0 | 0: OFF<br/>1: ON | 0(OFF)        |
| SSL_CIPHER | A cipher algorithms available for the server and client to use and negotiate with. Depending on your security policy, you can specify one or more cipher names and separate them by colons(:). You can check the list at [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) or execute command "$ openssl ciphers" in the shell environment.<br/>Ex) SSL_CIPHER=EDH-DSS-DES-CBC-SHA:DES-CBC-SHA |                  |               |

The following is a table comparing the server SSL properties and ODBC/CLI properties.

| Name                      | Server(altibase.properties) | ODBC/CLI                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SSL_ENABLE                | O                           | X<br/>The client is same meaning with SSL_ENABLE = 1 if CONNTYPE = SSL |
| SSL_PORT_NO               | O                           | X<br/>On the client, connect with CONNTYPE = SSL; PORT = 20443 without a separate SSL port. |

| SSL_CA                    | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_CAPATH                | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_CERT                  | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_KEY                   | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_CIPHER                | X                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_VERIFY                | X                           | O                                                            |

##### Step 4: Write a Client Program

Write a program to use SSL connection in the client application. You can find a sample program that uses SSL connection in the altibase directory. Please refer to $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SQLCLI/SSL.

####  Configure SSL for ADO.NET

- Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library
- Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate
- Step 3: Set .NET Connection Properties for SSL 
- Step 4: Write a Client Program

##### Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

This step is same as [Step 1 of Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI](#Step-1-Verify-the-OpenSSL-Library).

##### Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

This step is same as [Step 2 of Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI](#Step-2-Prepare-the-Clients-Certificate).

##### Step 3: Set .NET Connection Properties for SSL

When connecting to the server using SSL communication, users can specify the following properties in the connection string:

| Name       | Description                                                  | Range                    | Default Value |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------ |
| conn type  | Determine whether to connect to the server using SSL communication. If this value is set to "ssl", the connection is established using SSL communication. | ssl                      |               |
| port       | Specify the value of SSL_PORT_NO, which is the port number of the target server to connect to. | 0 ~ 65535                |               |
| ssl ca     | Refer to SSL_CA from [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI > Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL](#Step-3-Set-ODBCCLI-Properties-for-SSL). |                          |               |
| ssl capath | Refer to SSL_CAPATH from [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI > Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL](#Step-3-Set-ODBCCLI-Properties-for-SSL). |                          |               |
| ssl cert   | Refer to SSL_CERT from [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI > Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL](#Step-3-Set-ODBCCLI-Properties-for-SSL). |                          |               |
| ssl key    | Refer to SSL_KEY from [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI > Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL](#Step-3-Set-ODBCCLI-Properties-for-SSL) |                          |               |
| ssl verify | Refer to SSL_VERIFY from [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI > Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL](#Step-3-Set-ODBCCLI-Properties-for-SSL). | false:  OFF<br/>true: ON | false         |
| ssl cipher | Refer to SSL_CIPHER from [Configure SSL for ODBC/CLI > Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL](#Step-3-Set-ODBCCLI-Properties-for-SSL). |                          |               |

##### Step 4: Write a Client Program

To enable SSL communication in the client application, follow the instructions provided in the [Sample Using SSL Connection in ADO.NET](#Sample-Using-SSL-Connection-in-ADONET) section in "Appendix A: SSL Sample".
