# 4. Startup and Shutdown

---------------------

To provide service after creating a database, the Altibase server must be started to the server phase. This chapter describes the references for starting and shutting down the database.

### Startup Procedure

There are two ways to start up an Altibase server:

-   A database administrator logs in to the server using the sys account, accesses the server in -sysdba administrator mode, and then uses the privileges granted to him/her to manually start the server.
  
-   The server is started using a script called server.

To start up Altibase, first, execute iSQL using the -sysdba option in the same way as when creating a database.

The following demonstrates how to start up an Altibase database using iSQL:

```
$ isql –u sys –p manager –sysdba

----------------------------------------------
ISQL_CONNECTION = TCP, SERVER = 127.0.0.1, PORT_NO = 20300
iSQL(sysdba)>
```

> Note: The Altibase startup command can only be executed using the account with which Altibase (including iSQL)
was installed.
>

During the startup procedure, the status of the Altibase progress in sequence through the following phases:

1.  PRE_PROCESS

2.  PROCESS

3.  CONTROL

4.  META

5.  SERVICE

The startup command can be used with the following phase options:

```
STARTUP [PROCESS | CONTROL | META | SERVICE];
```

Users other than the SYS user can access the database only in the SERVICE phase.

> Note: *Altibase can only progress from earlier phases to subsequent phases; it is impossible to revert to a previous phase.*

The following is an example of starting the server in the service phase:

```
iSQL> startup service; 
Trying Connect to Altibase..... Connected with Altibase. 
TRANSITION TO PHASE: PROCESS
TRANSITION TO PHASE: CONTROL
TRANSITION TO PHASE: META
  [SM] Checking Database Phase:  .*.*.*[SUCCESS]
  [SM] Recovery Phase - 1: Preparing Database...[SUCCESS]
  [SM] Recovery Phase - 2: Loading Database : Dynamic Memory Version
                            Serial Bulk Loading
                            . is 8192k: *..[SUCCESS]
  [SM] Recovery Phase - 3: Skipping Recovery & Starting Threads...[SUCCESS]
                            Refining Disk Table [SUCCESS]
  [SM] Garbage Collection: ....................................... [SUCCESS]
  [SM] Rebuilding Indices [Total Count:61] ****************.....................
.................................................... [SUCCESS]
TRANSITION TO PHASE: SERVICE
          No IPC Initialize: Disabled
--- STARTUP Process SUCCESS ---
Command execute success.
```

The database performs the following tasks in each phase:

| Phase       | Tasks                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PRE-PROCESS | The initial phase. The server prepares to advance to the PROCESS phase. |
| PROCESS     | In this phase, the CREATE DATABASE and DROP DATABASE statements can be executed, a limited number of performance views can be used to obtain information, and property values can be changed. The server prepares to advance to the CONTROL phase. |
| CONTROL     | Media Recovery can be performed in this phase. The server prepares to advance to the META phase. If incomplete recovery is performed during the CONTROL phase, online logs must be reset when proceeding to the META phase. |
| META        | Meta data (the dictionary table) can be upgraded in this phase. For information about incomplete recovery, please refer to the section on [Complete vs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FQUZ3Tg55qkjy0M95erMM0ZOeU1dtlKwdKFOD5KEVg/edit#heading=h.1087892) [Incomplete Recovery ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FQUZ3Tg55qkjy0M95erMM0ZOeU1dtlKwdKFOD5KEVg/edit#heading=h.1087892)in Chapter 10. The server prepares to advance to the SERVICE phase. |
| SERVICE     | The SERVICE phase is the normal operational state of Altibase. Users other than the SYS user can establish connections to Altibase in this phase.SHUTDOWN NORMAL/IMMEDIATE/ABORT can all be executed. |





### Shutdown Procedure

To shut down the Altibase server that is currently running, use the SHUTDOWN statement. The following options are available: 

```
SHUTDOWN [NORMAL | IMMEDIATE | ABORT];
```

SHUTDOWN NORMAL and SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE can only be executed while Altibase is running in the SERVICE phase, whereas SHUTDOWN ABORT can be executed in any phase.

> Note: *The Altibase SHUTDOWN command can only be executed using the account with which Altibase (including iSQL) was installed.*

##### SHUTDOWN NORMAL

This method shuts down the server normally. The server waits for termination until all clients disconnect from the server. The following operations are performed internally when the server is shut down:

-   Threads that function to detect client-server communication sessions are shut down.
-   Service threads are shut down.
-   The storage manager is shut down.
-   Finally, after all the remaining tasks have been completely performed, the Altibase server shuts down.

When Altibase is shut down in this way, the following messages are output:

```
iSQL(sysdba)> shutdown normal;
Ok..Shutdown Proceeding....

TRANSITION TO PHASE : Shutdown Altibase
  [RP] Finalization : PASS
shutdown normal success.
```

##### SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE

When SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE is executed, the Altibase server first forcibly disconnects currently connected sessions, then rolls back pending transactions and shuts down the Altibase server.

When Altibase is shut down in this way, the following is output:

```
iSQL(sysdba)> shutdown immediate
Ok..Shutdown Proceeding....

TRANSITION TO PHASE : Shutdown Altibase
  [RP] Finalization : PASS
shutdown immediate success.
```

The server can also be forcibly shut down using a server script:

```
$ server stop

Alter success.
Alter success.
Alter success.
Ok..Shutdown Proceeding....

TRANSITION TO PHASE : Shutdown Altibase
  [RP] Finalization : PASS
shutdown immediate success.
```

##### SHUTDOWN ABORT

SHUTDOWN ABORT forcibly kills the Altibase server. When Altibase is shut down in this way, the contents of the database will likely be invalid, and thus the next time the server is executed, restart recovery will be automatically performed.

When Altibase is shut down in this way, the following is output:

```
iSQL(sysdba)> shutdown abort
iSQL(sysdba)>
```

The server can also be forcibly shut down using a server script.

```
$ server kill
