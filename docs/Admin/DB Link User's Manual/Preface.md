#### Documentation Conventions

This section describes the conventions used in this manual. Understanding these conventions will make it easier to find information in this manual and in the other manuals in the series. 

There are two sets of conventions:

-   Syntax diagram conventions
-   Sample code conventions

##### Syntax Diagram Conventions

This manual describes command syntax using diagrams composed of the following elements:

| Elements                                                     | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [![image1](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image1.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image1.gif) | Indicates the start of a command. If a syntactic element starts with an arrow, it is not a complete command. |
| [![image2](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image2.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image2.gif) | Indicates that the command continues to the next line. If a syntactic element ends with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |
| [![image3](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image3.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image3.gif) | Indicates that the command continues from the previous line. If a syntactic element starts with this symbol, it is not a complete command. |

One, and only one, option must be specified. |
| [![image8](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/raw/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image8.gif)](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.1/eng/media/SQL/image8.gif) | Indicates an optional element comprised of options.          |

A comma must precede all but the first element. |

##### Sample Code Conventions

The code examples explain SQL statements, stored procedures, iSQL statements, and other command line syntax.

The following table describes the printing conventions used in the code examples.

| Rules            | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |

| Italics          | Statement elements in italics indicate variables and special values specified by the user. | SELECT \* FROM *table_name*; <br/>CONNECT *userID*/*password*; |
| Lower case words | Indicate program elements set by the user, such as table names, column names, file names, etc. | SELECT ename FROM employee;                                  |
| Upper case words | Keywords and all elements provided by the system appear in upper case. | DESC SYSTEM_.SYS_INDICES_;                                   |
